INTERNATIONAL BUS.MCHS.,"Green Giants; As government efforts slow, our annual rankings show which companies are still carrying the eco-mantle.","When Newsweek ran its first Green Rankings two years ago, climate change was high on the agenda. The U.S. House had passed a cap-and-trade bill to put a price on carbon, and the world's biggest economies were about to make history with an agreement to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. Since then, green momentum has seriously stalled, at least in the public sector. The U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen at the end of 2009 ended without an agreement, and climate science in the U.S. has been politicized by Tea Partiers and others. A skeptical Congress, plus the ongoing economic downturn, have made environmental regulations a tough sell. Elsewhere in the world, there is some movement--such as in Australia, where the lower house has just passed a carbon tax--but it's slow. If governments are hesitating, many of the globe's big companies missed the memo. Top-ranked companies are approaching green projects with increasing tenacity, even in this weak economy. Corporate sustainability, it seems, is here for the long haul--it makes sense not just for the sake of the planet, but for business. ""Big companies have decided that this is a long-term play,"" says Thomas Lyon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.[…] Our Green Rankings, fully posted at Newsweek.com/green, comprise two lists, one that surveys the 500 biggest companies in America and another of the 500 largest companies in the world.

True, the last 15 months have soured investor sentiment towards the renewables sector. Share prices collapsed in the recessionary aftermath of the financial crisis, as surplus capacity increased and per-unit energy returns fell in line with a moribund oil price. However, eight new wind farms, consisting of 199 offshore wind turbines, were still connected to Europe's grids last year, while recent political initiatives, combined with the long-term fundamentals underpinning the global energy market, should provide renewed impetus for the sector. Grand ambitions  Westminster's firm commitment to nine UK development zones for offshore wind power represents one of the most significant steps to date for companies servicing the sector. Following a tender to develop the zones, a dozen European companies, including Centrica and SeaEnergy, have been awarded rights to develop these new deep-water sites with the eventual aim of generating as much as 32 gigawatts (GW) of electrical energy.

Surprised? P&G has been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index since its inception in 1999, and featured as a sector leader for seven of those nine years. The company is passionate about staff development, preferring to promote from within, and is a waste-management leader, with 95% of raw material inputs leaving plants as finished products. The corporation has been releasing a Sustainability Report since 1999 and in 2007, on its 170th anniversary, CEO A. G. Lafley instituted a significant change by embedding sustainability into P&G's core values. Still, in today's marketplace, this model CSR behaviour would only carry P&G so far.

PROCTER & GAMBLE,P&G launches Fairy gel in pebble pack," Household product giant PROCTER & GAMBLE has created a gel version of Fairy Non-Bio laundry detergent in the same pebble-shaped packaging as its low-temperature product Ariel Excel Gel.  Ariel Excel Gel was launched last October in the uniquely shaped packaging, which is smaller because the gel is concentrated. Although Fairy has now launched in the Excel Gel format, P&G declined to comment on internet speculation that it plans to roll out gel versions of its Bold 2-in-1 and Daz laundry products in the same pack.  Bath-based packaging design agency Studio Davis worked with P&G's in-house design team to create the original pack for Ariel Excel Gel.  The bottle includes a polypropylene dosing cap that can be removed from the body of the pack and a window that allows consumers to see how much gel is left. P&G said the compact, recyclable pack uses up to 45% less material than any other Ariel liquid detergents, allowing more bottles per case, pallet and truck to be transported, therefore reducing carbon emissions.  A P&G spokeswoman said: 'We are extremely pleased with how Ariel Excel Gel is performing in the market and it has been successfully received by our retail partners and consumers.' ",2009,3,1.0

PEPSICO,It's in the bag; Canada scores by sticking with 'noisy' chip bags,"One of the most lauded marketing campaigns in recent years involved an eco-friendly conversion by the snack food SunChips to a bag which would dissolve fully into compost within 14 weeks in a hot, municipal-style composter. When the high-profile effort was largely scrapped in the U.S. due to consumer complaints about the new bag's noisiness, Canadian Frito Lay executives decided to keep going with the noisy bag. Therein, another marketing opportunity was born -- one which capitalized upon Canadians' identity regarding environmental initiatives and played upon our conflicted blend of inferiority and superiority when it comes to defining ourselves in relation to our U.S. neighbours.[…] In a marketplace glut of green messaging that has left many consumers cynical or glazed over, the SunChips story was one of the breakthroughs of the past two years. At the launch, SunChips noted it produces 145,000 bags every day, the equivalent of 52 million bags a year that would not break down in landfills -- so the green-friendly marketing potential of a 100% biodegradable bag was pretty much perfect. Part of a broader company-wide effort the PEPSICO brand had made towards greater sustainability, the initiative won numerous awards and inspired glowing media coverage. And Frito Lay's effort did not appear to be lip service: the snack food manufacturer added a four-hectare (10-acre) bank of solar panels to provide as much as 75% of the energy required to make SunChips at a Frito-Lay plant in Modesto, Calif. It also buys renewable energy credits, and has recon-figured its manufacturing to utilize less water and fuel.[…] But once the bags were launched, consumers emboldened by social media trumpeted their own loud message: the bags made too much noise. Snarky YouTube videos showing people crinkling the bags became viral sensations; a Facebook page, ""Sorry but I can't hear you over this SunChips bag,"" currently numbers more than 54,000 members.[…] That's when the marketing opportunity in Canada arose. Press reports in Canada assumed the move was also happening to SunChips here, even though a corporate decision had been made to stay the course, said Tony Matta, vice-president of marketing for PEPSICO Foods Canada.[…] Some marketing experts say flip-flopping over the bag could harm the brand's integrity.",2011,1,7.0

WAL MART STORES,Comment & Debate: China at the crossroads: Admissions on emissions: The publication of pollution records is forcing companies to clean up their activities,"Globalisation has powered economic growth in developing countries such as China. Global logistics, low domestic production costs, and strong consumer demand have let the country develop strong export-based manufacturing, making the country the workshop of the world. It fuels growth and helps pull millions out of poverty. […] But a solution is emerging as environmental transparency expands in China. Evolving policy, alongside the increased capacity of environmental NGOs in China, and corporations' aspiration to achieve sustainability, have set the stage for broad public-private collaboration to tackle its pollution. Capitalising on increased public disclosure of pollution monitoring data, in 2006, our organisation, the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), launched the China Water Pollution Map, through which the public can access thousands of environmental quality and infraction records released by various government agencies. When people have access to these records, it puts extra pressure on companies on the list. Many chose to come to the IPE to explain what has gone wrong and how they are trying to fix it. However, most of these companies are multinationals and they represent just a tiny proportion of thousands of violators. In order to expand the effect of transparency on those who are not sensitive to public attention, corporate users need to check their suppliers. We have developed a database of over 40,000 records of specific citations of companies violating emission standards. Now companies such as GE, Wal-Mart, Nike and Esquel are using it to monitor the environmental compliance records of their suppliers. China, like many developing countries, is facing a serious environmental challenge. If major companies sourcing in developing countries care only about price and quality, local suppliers will be lured to cut corners on environmental standards to win contracts. Such market practice is destructive as it will lead to a globalised ""race down to the bottom"". […]",2009,5,19.0

""The life sounded romantic, going to work everyday by helicopter, so I got a job in the business."" [...] Mr. McInnes's latest deal is Plutonic Power Corporation, a TSX venture launched three years ago involving ambitious hydro-electric power projects that may eventually need at least $500-million to build. GENERAL ELECTRIC is doing due diligence on the financing now, he said. It's called ""run-of-river"" hydro- electric generation and does not involve dams, rerouting rivers, or reservoirs. It consists of creating a spillway where part of a river can flow directly down a steep pipeline to turbines before the water rejoins the river at a considerably lower altitude. No fuel is needed, no new technology. It's just a matter of using gravity to turn generators at the bottom of a big, long pipe. ""We have identified 22 locations in B.C. where this can best be done and got a 35-year contract in 8 from B.C. Hydro, the largest such project awarded in the province,"" he said. That contract is for run-of-river pipelines to generate 211 megawatts, enough to power a city of 150,000. The company is also bidding this year for permission to generate another 868 megawatts of capacity. All will eventually be linked by a transmission line, to be built by Plutonic, to the provincial grid. Underlying this initiative is the fact that B.C. Hydro can only generate new capacity that is clean environmentally, and all private sector. The province is a net importer of power despite huge hydro-electric capacity, because nothing has been built in 20 years despite population growth.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Corporate America warms to fight against global warming; Corporations see prospect of fat profits from new products friendly to environment,"WASHINGTON -- Corporate leaders don't normally invite the federal government to raise their taxes. But that's exactly what Paul Anderson is doing. Anderson, the chairman of Charlotte-based Duke Energy, wants the federal government to fight global warming by taxing companies based on the ""greenhouse gases"" they pump into the atmosphere -- just the sort of big-government remedy the Bush administration says would hobble the economy. For his efforts, Anderson has been excoriated by conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh and threatened with an ""exorcism"" by an industry peer. But Anderson, 61, is no closet left-winger. He's a registered Republican, Bush backer and member of the president's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. That such a Big Business stalwart is demanding federal action on climate change illustrates an unmistakable evolution in corporate thinking, motivated both by evidence that global warming already is affecting the economy and by the prospect of fat profits from new environment-friendly products. […] It's not just power companies that are agitating for action. Institutional investors are demanding that companies disclose their financial exposure to future climate changes. Insurers are abandoning underwriting in coastal areas threatened by costly Hurricane Katrina clones, and companies such as GENERAL ELECTRIC and DuPont are gearing up to prosper from the transition to a carbon-constrained world. Last year, Goldman Sachs Chairman Henry Paulson, now Treasury secretary-designate, warned that the time needed to address climate change was running out. […] Yet, the leaders of major U.S. corporations such as GENERAL ELECTRIC and DuPont say addressing climate change offers the technology-rich USA a chance to make -- not lose -- big money.

At the same time, Immelt said GE would double its annual revenue from a broad portfolio of environmentally sound products to $20 billion by 2010.

''We aren't measuring emissions,'' said Gary Hirshberg, chief executive of Stonyfield Farms and the chairman of Climate Counts. ''We are measuring commitment.''   The average score was 40 out of a possible 100, but most companies scored higher than they did in 2007. Nine had no change. Kraft Foods and Canon dropped slightly, but Wood Turner, Climate Counts's  project director, said that was because their disclosures were less detailed. […]   Companies with low scores tended to play down the ranking process. Avon Products scored 29 -- 18 points higher than last year, but still well below the ranking of competitors like PROCTER & GAMBLE and L'Oreal. […]",2008,5,7.0

That's what chip munchers will be able to do when Frito-Lay introduces what it says will be ""the world's first compostable chip bag"" by Earth Day 2010. The snack maker is rolling out a media campaign this month touting that it has taken the first step toward creating an environmentally friendly pouch for SunChips, a multigrain product that is already associated with healthier snacking. ""We're seeing a much greater concern about the planet by consumers,"" says Gannon Jones, vice president of portfolio marketing for Frito-Lay North America, a business unit of PEPSICO. And, Jones says, ""When it comes to the environment ... far and away consumers would say if there's one thing that you could improve, it would be your packaging."" Supermarket shelves are currently being filled with new 10.5-ounce SunChips bags with an outer layer made of plant-based polylactic acid (PLA). Researchers now are focusing on making the inside of the pouches, including the critical layer that keeps the chips crisp and fresh, eco-friendly as well.[…] Kraft, which has a goal to cut packaging by 150 million pounds by 2011, shrank the amount of plastic used in each Kraft salad dressing bottle by 19% last year, a change that will save more than 3 million pounds annually, says Roger Zellner, Kraft's director of sustainability for research, development and quality.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,GE Develops On-Site Wastewater Solution,"Part of the controversy surrounding hydraulic fracturing of shale gas reserves in the US is the billions of gallons of wastewater produced annually by the fracturing process. While recycling the water isn't new to the natural gas industry, mega-corporation GENERAL ELECTRIC throwing its hat into the ring of wastewater solutions is. GE has launched the ""mobile evaporator,"" a transportable machine reducing fresh water volumes needed in the fracturing process by 50% to 90%. Essentially, the self-contained mobile evaporator boils the wastewater, creating steam, which is condensed into distilled water that can be reused in ongoing fracturing operations. According to GE, the mobile evaporator will be released early next year for use throughout North America, as well as Europe and parts of Asia. Producers say that device will be particularly useful in areas of the US, such as the Marcellus Shale, which has been under particularly heightened scrutiny by local and regional governments because of wastewater concerns. […] Environmentalists and local leaders have become worried the wastewater produced from the projects could be contaminating fresh water supply. In fact, New York state has even banned shale drilling until studies can be conducted to determine fracturing's impact on public water sources ( NGW Aug. 23,p10 ). Other energy industry giants, such as Exxon Mobil, have also developed methods of recycling water needed for fracturing ( NGW Jun.29,'09,p1 ). But GE maintains that the boom in hydraulic fracturing in recent years has opened up major demand for water recycling solutions.",2010,10,18.0
WELLS FARGO & CO,Banks under scrutiny over coal funding,"Australian banks, highly dependent on offshore capital, will face increasing international scrutiny of their lending practices - particularly, their exposure to the coal industry. Greenpeace's study of domestic lending to Australia's coal industry, by Dutch economic consultancy Profundo, is a shot across the bows for our major banks which, like their international peers, are under growing pressure to limit funding to the key industries that are wrecking the climate. A Profundo analyst, Jan Willem van Gelder, the lead author of the study, says research by the International Energy Agency for the OECD in 2008 concluded that from now until 2030, two-thirds of all investment in the electricity sector must go to renewable energy, if the world is to stabilise atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at 450 ppm, limit global warming to 2 degrees and prevent runaway climate change. So of $US10.4 trillion ($10.7 trillion) of global investment in electricity, which the IEA expects we will need over the next two decades, at least $US6.9 trillion must to go to renewables.  […] American and European banks were adopting stricter policies on financing coal, van Gelder said. In the US, Bank of America, Citi, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo have signed up to a set of ""Carbon Principles"" designed to help banks evaluate carbon risks when lending to electricity projects. The New York Times reported in 8 that large commercial lenders were taking a stand on industry practices they regarded as risky to their reputations, such as mountaintop-removal coalmining and extracting oil from tar sands. Bank of America and JPMorgan both stopped lending to coal giant Massey Energy, and Wells Fargo announced that finance for mountaintop removal was ""limited and declining"". In Europe more banks are joining up to the Climate Group's ""Climate Principles"", obliging them to manage climate risk across the full range of financial services, including lending.

WAL MART STORES,Businesses lower footprint to beat the legal deadline,"Businesses lower footprint to beat the legal deadline A GROWING market demand for big business to go green is driving companies around the world to implement programmes that will reduce their carbon footprint or the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted in the course of their daily operations. The carbon disclosure project (CDP), an initiative aimed at gathering information on what companies around the world are doing to combat climate change, is the first real sign that global business is taking action voluntarily. Analysts predict that in the future businesses will be legally obliged to comply with CDP scorecard ratings by monitoring and publicly reporting on their greenhouse gas emissions. Some leading global retailers, such as Tesco and Wal-Mart, have gone as far as placing carbon labels on all their food lines.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,GE carbon capture,"Green technology US giant GENERAL ELECTRIC is planning a carbon-capture project at a proposed half-scale power station beside the planned Wandoan coal mine on Queensland's Darling Downs, to be operational by about 2016.  Carbon capture and storage, as it is called, is a part of the search for ``clean coal'' that is regarded with suspicion by environmentalists because of the doubtful viability of burying or ``sequestering'' the huge amounts of CO2 belched out by conventional coal-fired power stations. GE's proposal is different in that it will extract gas from the coal before it reaches the power station. Because gas produces no more than about 40 per cent of coal for the same energy output, the CO2 output is expected to be significantly lower. Wandoan, which is owned by mining group Xstrata, is in the early phase of construction, as is the proposed north-south 207km rail link that would take its non-power station coal output to the rail network that supplies the Gladstone export coal loaders. Phil Solomon of GE Australia said yesterday that the 400-megawatt Wandoan project would be able to put 90 per cent of the CO2 produced back into the power station's fuel stream, thus leaving very modest amounts of CO2 to bury. Mr Solomon said brown coal power stations produced about 1500kg of CO2 per megawatt hour, and conventional black coal stations about 800kg. ``After capture, we'd be left with about 180kg per megawatt hour.''",2009,7,27.0

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Climate action is a pro-growth strategy,"  IT IS striking that the science on climate change stands in contrast to economic policy direction in the run-up to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro this 6. More intense rainfall and extreme temperatures are linked with carbon emissions and man-made climate change in the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. Yet economic policies continue to position most countries on a high carbon path. The upshot of this wedge between science and economics is that carbon emissions keep climbing at alarming rates while temperatures continue to break records around the globe. Reversing this trend is crucial for people's well-being in large and small economies alike. Importantly, there is a premium on timely action as climate mitigation today will be far less costly than waiting to face even greater impacts. Similar to dieting, it is better to lose weight today than to delay action that risks bringing on life-threatening illnesses like heart disease tomorrow. […] There are signs that the economic opportunities of tackling climate are not being ignored. China, the country with the largest annual greenhouse gas emissions, envisages renewable energy generation to account for at least 15 per cent of energy consumption by 2020. Private investment in China's clean energy increased to over US$50 billion in 2010, almost 40 per cent above 2009 levels. Last year, China attracted US$45.5 billion in clean energy investments while deploying 20 gigawatts of wind and 2.3 gigawatts of solar power. Some of the world's largest private companies are also adopting climate strategies. GENERAL ELECTRIC's Ecoimagination programme produced US$85 billion in revenues in its first five years, doubling the pace of the rest of GE's portfolio. Kingfisher, the European home improvement group, generated &pound1.1 billion (S$2.2 billion) revenue in 2010-2011 from eco-products, 10.5 per cent of its retail sales. Yet for these positive steps to achieve anywhere near the scale needed to bring about a low carbon economy, basic changes in our economies are essential. For such changes to kick in, the public needs to recognise the vital link between climate response and economic success, and political leaders ought to take note and lead action. And for results to follow, economists and economic ministers must factor in the reality that climate action is a pro-growth strategy.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,"Sustainability: Sustainability approach effective forinvestors over the long run, says UBS","In 1924, a financial reporter by the name of Philip Carret began managing a pool of money for friends and family. He focused on companies with consistent earnings growth, strong balance sheets and dedicated management teams who themselves owned stakes in the companies, then held his investments for years - pioneering the concept of value investing and inspiring a whole generation of fund managers, including Warren Buffett. But that was not the only legacy that he left the investment industry with. Carret's fund, later named the Pioneer Fund and now the third-oldest mutual fund in the US, is also credited as being the first ethically oriented investment fund. For 50 years, it used a sin screen to avoid investments in industries such as alcohol, firearms, tobacco and gambling. Founded during Prohibition, the fund's screen made commercial sense. But Carret is said to have also enjoyed the influence he could exercise by controlling money. For example, he invested in Howe Caverns, an upstate New York geographical site, because he appreciated the outdoors and was interested in preservation. […] Clean water supply is constrained by infrastructure, climate change, urbanisation and industrial activities. Water management, therefore, is an important investment segment. Energy production accounts for 39% of waterwithdrawals in the US and 31% in the EuropeanUnion. The recent US shale gas boom has also led to an increased use of water in hydraulic fracturing methods. As a result, the markets for technologies and services providing alternative solutions - such as quality analysis equipment, water treatment equipment and chemicals, and water storage solutions - have grown sharply. GENERAL ELECTRIC and Siemens are currently the leading players in on-site watertreatment solutions. Meanwhile, agriculture accounts for 70% of withdrawals and 90% of consumptive use of water globally. In the face of resource competition and high input costs, companies proactively working with their agricultural suppliers, promoting more efficient farming methods and managing local watersheds will be better able to secure access to high-quality raw materials. Solutions to limit water demand such as irrigation systems should also gain traction. The only listed pure play in the irrigation space is Jain Irrigation Systems. Companies offering efficiency gains in supplying food, healthcare, energy and water present a strong basis for investing, if investors are patient enough to wait to reap the rewards. Issel believes it can take four to five years before a driver makes itself known or has an impact on an investment. ""The beautyof enhanced efficiency is that using fewer resources is both more sustainable and less expensive,"" he says. ""Ultimately, we believe sustainable investing is a theme that will endure even as it continues to evolve and, importantly, will provide your portfolio with more endurance over the long term than traditional investment approaches."" As a consequence of taking sustainability criteria into account, investors are making an impact by redirecting capital to reward certain companies while penalising others.

INTEL,Corporate concern on climate rises,"American businesses have reached a new phase regarding global warming, with more CEOs focused increasingly on what steps government should take, not on whether major new policies are needed.[…] The shift by business has come about gradually, and for varied reasons. For one, public consensus on the science of climate change has solidified, and corporations have followed with varying degrees of commitment. Some chief executives, though, simply have ""got religion"" on what they see as a major threat to both ecosystems and the economy.In addition, some companies see an entrepreneurial opportunity ahead, developing products and services to mitigate greenhouse-gas emissions.Beyond that, many business leaders are galvanized by two forces: the desire to have a seat at the table when policy is written, and the desire for certainty about the regulatory environment. It's a pattern that has emerged on other issues in the past, especially when business sees the risk of a patchwork of state regulations. ""We've seen the movie before.

WAL MART STORES,Leaner and Greener; Newsweek's annual rankings reveal the planet's biggest protectors--and polluters.,"Four years ago, it seemed every politician was hot and bothered about climate change--whether they believed it was real or not. But in 2012, with the economy stuck in second gear, the only green thing the candidates want to talk about is the stuff missing from people's pockets. The good news for fans of the planet is that big business has taken up the torch. Just look at Walmart, the biggest company in the world. It's reducing waste, buying renewable energy, and using its marketing clout to pressure suppliers to be more environmentally conscious, resulting in greener products on store shelves that cost the same, or even less, than their earth-polluting competition. Companies in every industry are realizing that the pursuit of profit is intertwined with environmental and social issues. They call it the ""triple bottom line"": people, planet, and profit.

The next generation GENERAL ELECTRIC (GEnx) engine that the Dreamliner uses had a problem with its hydraulics and oil leakage, according to sources.  This engine which had its first ran in 2006 by GENERAL ELECTRIC, was touted to be light weight, fuel efficient, and environmentally friendly reducing carbon emissions. It is used in Boeing's B777 and B787 aircraft along with Rolls Royce's Trent 1000 engine. GENERAL ELECTRIC is an American technology and financial services company. Its Aviation segment produces jet engines, aerospace systems and equipment for use in military and commercial aircraft.

WAL MART STORES,Wal-Mart's Detractors Come In From the Cold,"Over the last several months, a confidential report has circulated within the headquarters of Wal-Mart Stores, proposing sweeping changes to its employee health care plans. It looks like a typical corporate planning document, but it is not. The nine-page report, written by an Emory University professor, Kenneth E. Thorpe, was commissioned, paid for and given to Wal-Mart by its longtime foes, the Service Employees International Union, and a group the union finances, called Wal-Mart Watch. They are known for attacking the chain, not cooperating with it. […] definitely has helped the company,''  a retail analyst at Deutsche Bank, Bill Dreher, said. ''Those attacks hurt Wal-Mart.'' The union-financed campaigns were started in 2005. As the groups turned up the heat on the company, Wal-Mart was at first defensive, but eventually it responded in ways few of its critics expected. The company expanded its health care plans to cover more workers, though still not enough to satisfy the unions. And it made commitments to the environment, like becoming the country's biggest seller of more efficient light bulbs. Indeed, Wal-Mart has gone so far on some initiatives, like the environmental programs, that it has started to draw scattered attacks from the right, particularly from a group called the National Legal and Policy Center that has accused the company of giving in to political correctness. Now, the union-backed groups appear to have concluded it would be more constructive, sometimes, to engage Wal-Mart. That leaves them navigating a complex situation in which they have to decide, issue by issue, whether to shake hands with the company or to slap it. […]",2008,6,5.0
GENERAL ELECTRIC,New rating systems for green houses draw both interest and conflicts,"New rating systems for green homes have underscored the steady buzz about green building within the design and construction community, as well as the desire of industry groups to exert more influence on how green building is defined. In 1 2005, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) launched its Model Green Home Building Guidelines, a template for voluntary, self-administered rating systems. Meanwhile, the U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) long-awaited LEED for Homes specification is slated for pilot testing in mid-2005. […] The NAHB guidelines assign points to projects for energy efficiency, recycling, water conservation, indoor air quality, reducing the use of pesticides and other household chemicals, and limiting high-maintenance lawns. It also encourages a holistic approach to designing green homes--one that emphasizes environmental issues from the start; considers the interdependencies of building systems; and stresses durable, low-maintenance materials. Green building ""is growing exponentially, and NAHB didn't want to be caught in the undertow,"" says John Loyer, construction codes and standards specialist for NAHB. ""We anticipate some degree of legislation and code enforcement, and we wanted to offer not a standard, but a voluntary guideline that could be used by builders who want to green their construction practices."" In March, the group sponsored its first green building conference in Atlanta and gave awards to several projects (all of which preceded the release of the guidelines). […] Over the past five years, LEED has taken root at the federal, state, and local levels, mostly through design standards for public projects, and it shows signs of migrating to building codes as well. But in recent months, the NAHB and an industry consortium, the North American Coalition on Green Building, have been critical of the USGBC's standards- setting processes, opposing legislative and regulatory enforcement of sustainability measures. The coalition was established in 2003 by GENERAL ELECTRIC and trade groups representing manufacturers, forestry and wood-products companies, chemical companies, vinyl producers, and others dissatisfied with USGBC, which doesn't extend membership to trade groups. The coalition contends that this policy limits the influence of individual companies (though some coalition member companies are also USGBC members) and undercuts their claims of a consensus-based process, says Jerry Schwartz, the group's cochair. Schwartz, however, did credit USGBC's recent decision to use life-cycle analysis when hashing out standards. ""It's a step in the right direction. They did a great job of reaching out to trade groups,"" he says. USGBC president and C.E.O. Rick Fedrizzi counters, ""We feel our broad-based membership has done an extraordinary job of achieving a consensus-based platform for action. The only way everyone can profit is through open and vigorous dialogue, but we also know we must not let dialogue substitute for progress.""  ",2005,4,1.0

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Pay the price to secure the planet before it's too late,"IMAGINE that, three or four years ago, a well-qualified scientific team had presented a report arguing that there was a possibility of a life-threatening tsunami occurring in the Indian Ocean region, but that its impact could be mitigated by creating an early warning system, educating people to recognise danger signs, preserving mangroves, restricting shoreline development and pre-positioning emergency supplies on high ground. What would the response have been? Short articles based on the report might have appeared in some newspapers; if pressed on the matter, government officials would perhaps have responded that they were giving it serious consideration and some economist or 'environmental dissident' would have penned a response arguing that the danger of a tsunami and its likely consequences were so incalculable that it was not worth spending money on precautionary measures. The report would then have been ignored until December 27, 2004, when it would have been rediscovered and those in power who had ignored its findings would have been castigated for their lack of foresight, imagination, and sense of responsibility.

From a 5.1-megawatt cogeneration plant to waterless urinals, the new BANK OF AMERICA Tower rising at 1 Bryant Park is bristling with so much energy-conserving technology and sustainable materials that it ought to be colored green. ``From above, it will be,'' says Lynn Reiger, BANK OF AMERICA's project manager, pointing out that the tower will have a roof of plants that will act as a thermal barrier and help collect rainwater. It's no coincidence that the tower, which could be the first platinum-rated office building in New York, has Douglas Durst as one of its developers. Mr. Durst is a pioneer in environmental building, and his building at 4 Times Square would have been the city's first gold-certified tower if the LEED rating system had existed when it was completed in 2000.[…] The centerpiece of BANK OF AMERICA's effort to minimize the building's environmental footprint is its cogeneration plant. Running on clean-burning natural gas, it will contribute as much as 70% of the electricity to floors seven through 51, Ms. Reiger says. Mr. Durst also takes water conservation a step further. As with the other green towers, the BANK OF AMERICA building has a ``gray'' water system that recycles used water, but it also features no-flush, ``waterless'' urinals. Gravity takes care of drainage, and a biodegradable liquid floats in the waste to absorb odors.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,UK wind power given £100m boost by GE,"The US conglomerate GENERAL ELECTRIC (GE) announced plans yesterday for an offshore wind turbine manufacturing plant in Britain, creating up to 2,000 jobs. The company said it had not yet decided where to build the facility, but its plans would result in about £100m being invested in Britain, creating clean energy jobs at both the new site and in the supply chain. The UK is well placed to harvest clean energy from powerful sea winds, but the closure of a Vestas plant on the Isle of Wight last 8 was highly embarrassing for ministers, leaving Britain without a significant turbine manufacturer. .  The construction of thousands of huge offshore turbines is a key part of government plans to meet its commitments to cut greenhouse gases, as well as ensure the continuity of energy supply over the next decade as nuclear and coal-fired stations reach the end of their life. GE's plans are linked to an announcement in yesterday's budget of a £60m competition to help develop port facilities for the offshore wind industry. ""This investment is tied to the successful deployment of the UK government's port development fund,"" a company statement said. The company said the project will form part of a euros 340m (£305m) investment in Europe's wind energy industry over 10 years. In addition to the UK manufacturing site, it plans to build development centres in Norway, Sweden and Germany. GE's UK managing director, Magued Eldaief, said: ""We believe offshore wind has a bright future. These investments will position us to help develop Europe's vast, untapped offshore wind resources.""

GE is the technical partner to the project which would also produce 400mmscuf of gas per day in excess of the requirement of the power plant when completed. The excess gas would however be made available to other power plants in need of additional gas supply. The group equally talked about its investment in renewable energy sources like solar and wind, indicating its perceived fear with the policy direction for the renewable energy sector. A statement from the ministry of power quoted Ribieras to have said the investors have acclaimed Nigeria's power divestment programme as a bold and decisive reform, but equally expressed concern on delay associated with transmission of money from consumers to those who produce the energy. He also stated the apprehension over unnecessary delays in projects coming upstream from conception to its final completion, to which it wants the government to keep to its commitment with the privatisation exercise.

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY,China's BYD looking to plug in; Electric cars: New battery causing a buzz,"The car is a pretty ordinary looking sedan, which is not an altogether bad thing for an electric car. The weird, boxy ""green-look"" of so many of the pioneer models had limited appeal.  But it's the battery in BYD Auto's new E6 fully electric car, not the design, that is currently causing the buzz in the decidedly dejected auto industry. Instead of being made with lithium ion, which is expensive, increasingly hard to come by, environmentally unfriendly, and potentially dangerous in a crash, BYD has devised a battery that uses ferrous ion, which is cheap, plentiful and green. If it turns out to be as functional as the Chinese company claims, it could be the breakthrough needed to finally bring electric cars into the mainstream. Warren Buffett obviously thinks it is. The U.S. financier invested $230 million in BYD last year.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Funds and pensions with $21 trillion pressure companies on global warming,"Investment funds and pensions with $21 trillion in assets are pressuring utilities and other companies to address their carbon dioxide emissions, and they are getting more attention, according to a report issued last week from the Carbon Disclosure Project. But many companies are taking no action and only a few have reduced their emissions, according to CDP, which is a cooperative effort of 155 institutional investors. They fear that the companies are ignoring the risks that carbon entails, from the cost of regulatory compliance to environmental impacts. […] He spoke at a presentation of the report, which took place at the New York headquarters of JPMorganChase. That company has instituted a CO2 reduction program because climate change ""is too big for us or our clients to ignore,"" said Rick Lazio, vice president for global government relations, and former member of Congress from New York. In this year's survey, more than 90% of the respondents said climate change poses risks or opportunities for their companies, according to the report. But only 51% have launched emission reduction programs and only 13% have reduced their CO2 emissions, while 17% actually reported an increase. CDP estimated the future risk to electric utilities (with power plants) and determined that the most exposed utilities in North America could face compliance costs of more than 20% of net income, while the least exposed face less than 1%. That is based on a scenario where companies must reduce emissions by 20% over seven years and the cost of carbon offsets is $50/ton. Outside North America, the most exposed companies would face compliance costs of 8% of net income. […] Reducing greenhouse gases provides other benefits, said Margaret Beckett, the U.K. Secretary for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. DuPont has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 67%, largely through cutting energy consumption by 9%. This has saved the company $2 billion in energy costs, she noted. Beckett also stressed that there are business opportunities in addressing climate change, as GENERAL ELECTRIC 's efforts show.

Exxon Mobil,Paw Prints Disappearing for Siberia's Amur Tiger,"Over the last six years, Yury Dunishenko has walked 12,000 kilometers through the snow. He has been looking for paw prints left by Amur tigers, an endangered species in the Far East Khabarovsk region. To operate such a large scale monitoring project, Dunishenko and his colleagues from the Khabarovsk Wildlife Management Institute teamed up with a group of experienced local hunters. […] ""The risk of the species' extinction has not been averted,"" Dunishenko said last week during a meeting in Moscow celebrating 10 years of working to save the tigers. ""The research showed that the population has lost its ability to reproduce normally."" There are only 60 Amur tigers left in the Khabarovsk region and more than 300 still roaming the vast Primorye region. Dunishenko said that if conditions remain unchanged, the tigers will disappear from Khabarovsk in 20 to 30 years. Vast effort and serious investment has gone into keeping the Amur's numbers stable, but saving a large predator such as this is a monumental task.

Last weekend in Copenhagen, Soros announced he was putting $US1 billion ($1.09bn) into carbon-reduction technology, starting with a substantial investment in a US company that claims to be well advanced with a program that would extract 90 per cent of the carbon emissions from coal-fired power generators. Soros was addressing an international meeting of editors in the Danish capital, where governments in December will try to hammer out a new global climate agreement to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. […] The challenge for Australia is to realise there is a sense of urgency about the green revolution. The time is now for locking in research links with the US, so together we can accelerate discoveries and ensure we are an integral player in the scale-up and role-out of clean coal, geothermal, algae-based biofuels and solar technologies. For Queensland, dependent on coal exports, clean coal technology is critical to securing the long-term sustainability of the coal industry and protecting the thousands of jobs it supports. Queensland's reputation for biofuels science and world-class infrastructure puts it in the box seat to capitalise on advances towards a sustainable aviation biofuel based on algae. Boeing, with its regional headquarters in Brisbane, is leading a cross-industry team of Honeywell/UOP, Air New Zealand, Continental Airlines, Japan Airlines, GENERAL ELECTRIC, CFM, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce. Even Boeing's competitor Airbus has expressed interest in the consortium. Virgin Atlantic has done test flights (and of course Virgin's headquarters are in Brisbane). The aviation industry believes that by 2011 it will have certification of a blend of the aviation hydrocarbon fuel known as Jet A-1 and biofuel. It's estimated biofuels could provide up to 30 per cent of all commercial jet fuel by 2030, and Queensland -- and Australia -- has the potential to be a global hub for this industry.

WAL MART STORES,THE COMING OF AGE OF SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTING,"GIVEN THE GROWING MEDIA COVERAGE OF, AND PUBLIC INTEREST in, the underbelly of corporate America, it is no surprise that socially responsible investing (SRI) is going mainstream. Although the movement originated with faith-based groups that didn’t want to invest in companies whose purposes were at odds with their beliefs (many religious groups shun companies that produce alcohol, tobacco products or weapons), SRI is now attracting a much broader market. Corporate scandals, concerns over global warming and dwindling natural resources, and a sense that shareholder activism can lead to more ethical business practices are causing a growing number of investors to consider SRI. Some studies even suggest that investors’ interest in SRI outstrips that of financial planners—who may be missing an important opportunity. […] Even companies like Wal-Mart are getting into the act—in part, to attract investors and customers, but also to lower their costs in the future.

Walmart's purchasing power has allowed it to innovate and at the same time reduce the costs of the innovation. Mr Zimmerman used light-emitting diode (LED) lighting as an example, which Walmart developed with GENERAL ELECTRIC and is now an industry standard. Electricity-saving innovations at new Makro stores have already led to a 25% reduction in energy consumption, and with Walmart on board the company is hoping to increase this saving. Walmart plans that by 2015 it will be supplied 100% by renewable energy, will create zero waste, will have made a commitment to sustainable agriculture, and will have pledged to sell $1bn of food sourced from 1-million small and medium-sized farmers. valliea@bdfm.co.za",2011,11,29.0

WAL MART STORES,One to Grow On,"Aveda and Wal-Mart. A few years ago, it would have seemed that these two companies had little in common. One built its brand on natural products and the promise of eco-friendly practices, the other on the promise of low prices. But shortly after Hurricane Katrina, environmental issues became a chief talking point for Wal-Mart CEO Lee Scott, who laid out three environmental goals for the company: to be supplied 10 percent by renewable energy, to create zero waste; and to sell products that sustain not only company resources, but the environment.  With more than 60,000 suppliers around the world, Wal-Mart aims to reduce overall packaging by 5 percent by 2013. It's an admirable goal, one that would remove 213,000 trucks from the road and save 76 million gallons of diesel fuel in a year. And to achieve it, last month the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer formally introduced an environmentally minded packaging scorecard that evaluates suppliers based on the sustainability of their packaging and rates them against their competitors. Buyers use those scorecard results to inform their purchasing decisions. Although experts in sustainability circles say the scorecard is far from perfect, all agree it's a positive start and long-term results of this corporate commitment could be enormously beneficial to the environment.   ""When Wal-Mart sneezes, the world catches a cold,"" says Donald Carli, a senior research fellow with the nonprofit Institute for Sustainable Communication in New York and president of consultancy Nima Hunter. ""The fact that they've made sustainable packaging and sustainability in general a governance priority has tremendous impact.

No traveling is involved, no money is spent on fares or accommodations, and information can easily be downloaded and stored for future use. Another aspect of cyber-conferencing -- one that is particularly appropriate for an event promoting sustainability -- is its minimal environmental impact. Mark Smith, creative director of RMR Design, explains: ''It is ironic that a conference [on sustainability], particularly an international one, has a large environmental impact.

At age nine, he'd led his first environmental campaign (a petition to impeach Ronald Reagan's much loathed EPA chief, James Watt). In high school, he founded the Sierra Student Coalition and built it into a 30,000-strong force that pushed through legislation to preserve a swath of California desert. He joined the Sierra Club's board of directors while still in university, and in 1997 he became, at age 23, its youngest president ever - his face splashed across the pages of Rolling Stone as the poster boy for a reinvigorated Gen-X strain of activism. […]  ""Everything that people say is wrong with Wal-Mart is wrong with Wal-Mart,"" Mr. Werbach says afterward. ""And so is the opposite. Wal-Mart is just so big."" He welcomes the criticism; he came to Wal-Mart not as a public relations officer but as an external sustainability consultant through his San Francisco-based firm Act Now Productions (recently absorbed by the Publicis Groupe, the world's fifth-largest marketing conglomerate).  The truly unexpected - even revolutionary - idea contained in Mr. Werbach's speech is that Wal-Mart might be sustainability's most powerful advocate. With 4,100 stores in the U.S. and more than 300 in Canada, Wal-Mart, he notes, is the continent's largest trucking company, its most voracious consumer of electricity and - with a workforce of 1.3 million in the U.S. and 75,000 in Canada - its biggest employer. […] ""Wal-Mart can't stop sustainability now,"" says Mr. Werbach, ""because people who work there are very invested in it.

But, in Singapore, five traditional medicine shops visited by The Straits Times said that sales of herbal potions used to treat male impotence, or taken as aphrodisiacs, have not been affected noticeably, despite the introduction of Viagra. Ms Joanna Wong, 40, marketing communications manager for Eu Yan Sang, a major distributor and retailer of traditional Chinese medicines here, suggested that there has been no drop in the sales of herbal performance-boosters because ""Chinese medicines tend to be used for holistic nourishment of the body"".[…] Elsewhere, though, PFIZER may just have hit, albeit unwittingly, on the answer that animal activists have been waiting for.

''It's a matter of getting people to think about where fish comes from,'' says MSC regional director Duncan Leadbitter. He says the movement to protect the fisheries came from the corporate world rather than from consumer pressure. The collapse of Canadian cod stocks, and its complete over-fishing, had prompted the giant Unilever corporation to act a decade ago. Today, supermarket chains are making the moves.

GOOGLE,Power duel over sky's high winds,"MAN'S search for renewable power is about to take to the skies. Companies and inventors are casting their hopes -- and millions of dollars -- upwards as they seek to exploit the strong, steady winds circling the planet at higher altitudes. High-altitude wind power -- essentially putting wind turbines in the air -- received a recent boost when half a dozen companies and other entrepreneurs met at a conference in northern California to discuss how to get their businesses off the ground.  Wind power is accepted as an important part of the planet's search to replace energy from fossil fuels. Recent research into high-altitude winds has shown that jet-stream winds can be far more powerful and reliable than winds closer to Earth's surface, providing an immense source of energy if companies can find a way to tap into it at a reasonable cost. […] One proposed generator resembles a big floating ball that rolls in the wind, tethered by an electric cable 1000ft (305m) off the ground. Another looks like a helicopter, with four huge rotors designed to fly nearly l8km into the sky.

In doing so it gave passengers their first chance to test the biggest claims Boeing makes for the way it has improved passenger comfort. I was aboard the 787 on its inaugural commercial flight last year from Tokyo to Hong Kong, but in a four-hour flight one couldn't be sure whether the lower cabin pressurisation and higher humidity had really made a difference.  On the flight to London, I was aware of the improvement. After an uncivilised 5am check-in in the Middle East I arrived in an icy London considerably less frazzled than usual after that length of time in the air. Undoubtedly the cabin atmosphere was a factor, but the general airiness also helped.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Distributed Energy - Urban power comes to Melbourne.,"GE is supplying a natural gas fired 2 MW Jenbacher J612 unit to power a cogeneration plant at the heart of a district heating and distributed cooling scheme in the Dandenong commercial district of Melbourne, Australia.  The cogeneration plant will provide electricity and thermal energy for a major urban revitalisation initiative in the city that will also help to meet the area's growing power needs. It is being built by Cogent Energy and will play a central part in the VicUrban-led Revitalising Central Dandenong (RCD) initiative that is rejuvenating the south-east region of Melbourne. The collaboration marks GE's first urban district energy project in Australia. Clarke Energy Australia, GE's authorised distributor for Jenbacher gas engines in the country, will supply project owner Cogent Energy with the J612 unit for for the first phase of the new power facility. There is a provisional plan to expand the scheme to 6 MW at a later date. The J612 system was shipped to the Dandenong site in 1, with commercial operation set to begin this year. By reducing overall electricity demand the engine is expected to avoid the emission of about 9900 tons of carbon dioxide a year, the equivalent of removing more than 5500 cars from the road, with a combination of high overall thermal efficiency and a reduction in the commercial district's reliance on energy from the grid. The Jenbacher gas engine is designed to run only on gaseous fuels, which is said by its maker to result in higher generator efficiency, reliability and environmental performance. The plant also will have the capacity to produce a surplus of hot water, which Cogent Energy intends to sell back to local commercial buildings to provide cooling via absorption chillers owned by the occupants of the buildings they serve. 'Helping central Dandenong transform itself into a vibrant, 21st century retail and services district will require a reliable, cleaner, cost-effective supply of energy to meet the growing needs of the area's business and residential communities,' said Blair Healy, manager of Cogent Energy. '(This system) ... offers the optimal energy efficiency we required to make this project successful.' GE has been involved in the Australian market since 1902 when GE installed one of the electric motors to operate the Pyrmont Bridge over Darling Harbour, Sydney. More recently, in September last year, GE contracted to supply an integrated solution of on-site power and water filtration equipment to a consortium that is building a water treatment plant on behalf of Australian coal seam gas company QGC. The project, located at QGC's Kenya site near Chinchilla in Queensland, integrates Jenbacher and Waukesha gas engines for the first time. The units will generate on-site power for GE's membrane and thermal water treatment technologies that will desalinate the water produced during the extraction of coal seam gas. ",2012,6,7.0

The promotion on DawnSavesWildlife.com has raised nearly $383,000 in donations so far. Dawn launched a new ad for its wildlife rescue efforts on Earth Day and was still in the midst of a related promotional fundraiser just as the environmental catastrophe was unfolding. Earlier this week, it helped drive the point home further, shipping 1,000 bottles of Dawn to animal rescuers in the Gulf Coast, and plans to follow with another 1,000 by week's end, said spokeswoman Susan Baba. Lest P&G be accused of opportunism, the ads and donations are extensions of one of the company's oldest cause-related marketing programs, now in its fourth decade, which got its original impetus from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Corporate accountability - Called to account,"Human Resources magazine unveils its first ranking of UK companies specifically measured on how well they are embedding accountability for their environmental and social impacts into their HR strategies. When TNT's CEO Peter Bakker went to rub shoulders with the world's most influential leaders at Davos earlier this year, he travelled there in a Smart car. Bakker is one of a growing band of business leaders who is leading by example in setting an agenda to embed in his company - and its employees - a more responsible attitude to their social and environmental impact In fact, it is highly likely he is not the only member of staff driving one of these eco-efficient vehicles - all employees are offered a pounds 2,280 incentive to make the switch for themselves. TNT's mission is for clear and transparent corporate accountability. With recent resignations of leaders at HP and Deutsche Post for hidden dealings, to criticism of companies such as Gap and Mattel for their management of global supply chains, a swathe of high-profile incidents show that companies need to be more accountable for their social and environmental impacts.  But which large corporations are actually meeting these commitments? Which are building management systems and processes that embed accountability into the heart of their core business strategy? And what impact does this have on employees and HR? […] HSBC is the top performer on business strategy. This looks at how social and environmental goals are incorporated into business decisions. HSBC has built a strong position recently on climate change. It is 'providing real investment solutions', says group chairman Stephen Green, 'which enable our clients to incorporate climate change into their investment decisions.' Other banks such as ABN Amro and Barclays also score well here, emphasising the huge importance of managing who they lend to and what they lend for. Governance examines the processes that hold executives and board members accountable for achieving social and environmental targets. Oil companies such as Shell are strong performers here, being under the spotlight for both climate change and health and safety. Stakeholder engagement, the third domain, encompasses quality of public disclosure, assurance and involvement with stakeholders, including employees. Vodafone and Tesco are good performers, with comprehensive processes to engage with stakeholders, identify issues and back-up communications from trusted auditors. GENERAL ELECTRIC is among the best performers when it comes to the impact domain.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,"Stimulus funds for clean energy largely unspent; Only 63,000 of the jobs directly created or saved by the stimulus bill last year were clean-energy jobs. That number should rise, economists say.","Making a ""tremendous down payment on the clean energy transformation"" of the United States was a top priority of the Obama administration's economic stimulus package - but, despite some notable accomplishments, it remains mostly a promise at this point. Most of the funds from the stimulus still haven't been spent, and the clean-energy down payment is a long way from being completed. Its impact so far on those jobs has only been lightly felt in pockets across the nation, economists and others watching its impact in their regions say. ""It's fair to say the stimulus is a down payment, but I wouldn't call it a tremendous down payment at this point,"" says Joan Fitzgerald, an expert on economic development at Northeastern University in Boston, who has analyzed the stimulus's impact on the wind-power and other clean-technology industries. Overall, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, or stimulus bill, has seen $263 billion spent of the $787 billion available by the end of last year. As a result, the US economy is now employing about 1.5 million to 2 million more workers, the President's Council of Economic Advisors recently reported - and other independent economists agree. But so far, just one-third of the roughly $90 billion ($60.7 billion in direct spending and $29.5 billion in tax incentives) targeting the clean-energy sector has actually hit the street - to fund wind-farm development, solar plants, battery factories, high-speed rail, and home weatherization, among many other projects. As a result, just 63,000 of the jobs directly created or saved by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act by the end of last year were clean-energy jobs, the president's economic council reports. That so-far modest impact should become much more significant as the US Department of Energy ramps up its approval process and spends the remaining billions by September, David Sandalow, assistant secretary of energy for policy and international affairs, said at a press conference Wednesday. Over the next two years, the $90 billion spent on clean energy is expected to create 720,000 job-years of employment. In addition to jobs, some 16,000 megawatts of wind, solar, geothermal, and other renewable energy capacity propelled by the stimulus will power about 4 to 5 million homes. ""Each one of [these jobs] is doing work made possible by the recovery act,"" Mr. Sandalow said. ""The recovery act has been crucial to unlocking financing"" for new wind, solar, geothermal power projects. High-speed rail construction in Wisconsin, new-generation plug-in hybrid vehicle battery factories in Detroit and wind farm turbines sprouting across the US landscape last year - all would not exist without the stimulus passed by Congress last year, other observers agree. ""Some folks on one end of the spectrum say the stimulus hasn't done a darn thing,"" says Rob Sargent, who tracks clean-energy for EnvironmentAmerica, a Washington-based advocacy group. ""If you look around and see - it has led to investments in clean energy of a magnitude we've never seen."" Other expert watchers agree. ""Broadly speaking, the stimulus has helped an enormous amount,"" says Alex Klein, research director for Emerging Energy Research, a market research company based in Cambridge, Mass. ""Treasury grants have helped expedite wind development, manufacturing incentives have jump-started battery manufacturing - and kept wind and solar manufacturing in the US alive."" The stimulus has expedited both project development and helped to build local supply chains, Mr. Klein says. But some note that the stimulus, while keeping the wind-power and other renewable industries from tanking in 2009, has not worked a miracle on US clean-energy manufacturers' competitiveness. ""We're not competitive yet with other clean-energy export nations,"" says Kevin Book, managing partner with ClearView Partners, a Washington energy research and consulting firm. ""There's an argument to be made that we could become the next big manufacturer of clean tech, but we're not the most compelling candidate right now. China and Germany are ahead of us."" News reports highlighting Texas wind-farm projects that purchased Japanese-made turbines - and others with plans to purchase turbines from China - have had congressmen throwing up their hands in protest. So is Bob Lloyd, plant manager at Clipper Wind Power's Waterloo, Iowa, manufacturing plant. His plant had layoffs a year ago and is still operating at less than half its capacity. ""We're trying to build this product,"" he says. "" 'Hey, we're paying taxes, and we don't want to pay taxes to bring in foreign-made products' - that's the feeling of folks around here."" Clipper and GENERAL ELECTRIC are America's only domestic wind-turbine manufacturers. But while Clipper's business is picking up, their plight highlights a conundrum: Until US demand for clean energy grows, it will be hard to develop domestic clean-energy manufacturing that can out-compete overseas companies on price as well as quality, experts say. The stimulus support can't produce an overnight transformation for US clean-energy manufacturers, Mr. Book says. What's needed is a ""natural demand"" for clean-energy, or a ""legislative demand."" And yet, a cap-and-trade climate bill that would do just that, by putting a price on carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, is stalled in Congress. ""Unless natural demand for clean energy develops in the US - or it can become a competitive exporter to markets overseas, the spending won't have succeeded,"" he says.

INTERNATIONAL BUS.MCHS.,PM gets bad greenhouse mail,"THE PRIME Minister's recent attempt to wedge the Labor premiers on their proposed carbon trading system reveals not only John Howard's ignorance of energy options and his bad faith on global warming, but also the insularity of much of the Australian debate on these issues. Some dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions have already been achieved, but seem to be little-known in Australia.Earlier this month, Howard told Parliament that reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 would lead to a 10 per cent fall in GDP, a 20 per cent fall in real wages, an effective doubling of petrol prices and a staggering 600 per cent rise in electricity and gas prices. This statement shows that Howard and his economic advisers are egregiously uninformed on world's best practice, which flatly contradicts his claims. Since 1994, global chemical giant DuPont has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 72 per cent, and it hasn't gone broke in the process. In fact, this remarkable accomplishment cost DuPont less than nothing: it saved $2billion.Five other corporations have reduced their emissions by 60 per cent or more, and collectively they have saved another $2billion. Nor are they obscure corporations: IBM, British Telecom, Alcan, NorskeCanada and Bayer.

COCA COLA,"A lot of bottle; LIFESTYLE With so much waste generated at Christmas, Kate Hodal explains how plastic can be recycled ","When corporate giant Coca-Cola decided to lay aside its pre-occupation with consumerism to help the environment, many were aghast. But it's true: the soft drink company joined forces with environmental charity Together to promote the recycling of plastic at Christmas. As a gimmick the company created plastic Coca-Cola-shaped Christmas decorations and donated money to Together every time someone bought one. The firm is hoping this new focus will reduce the UK's dependency on fossil fuels and that if it encourages people to recycle their plastic bottles, it could start a recycling revolution.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Senate panel OKs energy-efficiency bill over GOP member's vigorous objections,"A Senate panel passed a bill last week that would bolster energy-efficiency standards for air conditioners, heat pumps and other household appliances, despite opposition from Republicans who argued that the measure will cut down on consumer choice. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved the Implementation of National Consensus Appliance Agreement Act, or INCAAA, by a vote of 18-4 on Tuesday, with all four dissenting votes coming from Republicans. The bill (S. 398) will now move to the full Senate for consideration. New Mexico Senator Jeff Bingaman, the committee's Democratic chairman, said the measure would save consumers more than $43 billion on their energy bills by 2030, while reducing carbon-dioxide emissions by some 47 million metric tons per year. Bingaman and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, the panel's top Republican, are the bill's chief sponsors. As of last week, the measure had 25 other cosponsors. The bill would codify a 2009 agreement among industry groups that sets efficiency standards for furnaces, heat pumps and central air conditioners, as well as energy and water-efficiency standards for refrigerators and freezers, clothes washers and dryers, and dishwashers. It would also set new efficiency standards for some outdoor lighting. INCAAA has drawn wide support from industry, including the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, Johnson Controls and GENERAL ELECTRIC. Environmental groups and consumer advocacy groups are also on board, as is the Energy Department, which says the measure would make the regulatory process more efficient. Among other things, the bill allows anyone to petition DOE to change energy-efficiency testing procedures. A key complaint has been that DOE test procedures are out of date. […]",2011,4,18.0
WAL MART STORES,Big-box battle brewing;  Critics of a proposed Wal-Mart franchise look to Vancouver City Hall to halt project," Elementary school teacher Louise Seto became involved in community protest to fight the relocation of a casino in her south Vancouver neighbourhood. She was relieved when the developers decided to abandon the site. […] ""Politicians understand they have to, at least at election time, listen to the people,"" said Mel Lehan, who ran as an NDP candidate against Liberal Premier Gordon Campbell in the recent provincial election. Mr. Lehan was part of the protest yesterday against Wal-Mart.  ""All we need is one person who wants to be elected and understands that the people of Vancouver do not want this big-box store,"" he said.   Wal-Mart has proposed a $10-million, environmentally friendly building that could set a new standard for construction of big-box stores. The 143,125 square-foot (13,296 square-metre) store, which has been designed by Vancouver architect Peter Busby, would feature three 45-metre windmills to power the mechanical systems, deep wells for geothermal heating and cooling, and skylights to reduce artificial light in the store. Rain water would be collected on the roof for use in the toilets. The parking lot would be of permeable asphalt, to allow storm-water runoff to drain directly into the ground. The plans also call for the development to be in an ""orchard-like"" setting, with 250 six-metre-high dogwood trees scattered throughout the site.  The U.S. retailing giant has said the environmentally friendly design would cut energy use by 37 per cent. Water use will drop by 48 per cent and carbon dioxide emissions by 40 per cent.

COCA COLA,The ice dream,"Robert Swan became the first person to traverse the North and South Poles on foot. Now the explorer and philanthropist is working to preserve these environments - with a little help from his son Barnaby. By Tony Magnusson. For someone who's flown around the world three times in the past month, Robert Swan looks remarkably well rested. Tanned and fit, with a buzz cut and piercing blue eyes, he has the measured confidence of someone who's learnt self-discipline the hard way. […] Born and raised in the north of England, Swan became fascinated with Antarctica as a young boy after hearing that the continent was twice the size of Australia. […] . And when it comes to preserving the Antarctic, and elsewhere, Swan has found a little good news goes a long way. ""The only way through a situation is to be positive and inspirational. You need to look at solutions. I've got no money, but by forming the right partnerships, you can really shift some stuff."" Which is why Swan is in Sydney, to promote the COCA-COLA Community Awards, the winners of which will accompany him on the Sydney to Hobart yacht race (his first) and a trip to the Antarctic (his 16th - but who's counting?). He's looking for ""real Australians, people in the community who've said, 'Sod it, I'm going to do something'"", rather than being paralysed by apathy or a feeling of powerlessness.[…] The COCA-COLA Community Awards recognise unsung heroes in the community who have contributed to the local environment or motivated young people to lead active lifestyles. The winner of the Environmental Award will join Robert Swan on a 16-day Antarctic expedition next February. The winner of the Youth Activity Award will join Swan aboard his yacht for this year's Sydney to Hobart yacht race. (The winner will have to complete an accredited sailing course prior to the race.) Three finalists in each category will each receive a $5000 grant. Entrants must be permanent residents of Australia aged 18 and over.

WAL MART STORES,Laundry soap gets eco-friendlier; Company sells detergent in a cardboard bottle,"Imagine spotting this on the supermarket shelf: liquid laundry detergent in a cardboard bottle. You can stop imagining. On Friday, Seventh Generation, a maker of non-toxic household cleaners, will announce plans to roll out a laundry detergent bottle made from 100% recycled cardboard and newspaper.  In a nation of eco-minded consumers who increasingly shun plastic, the move could be an environmental slam-dunk. Major brands from Wal-Mart to P&G have major environmental programs in place. Some 53% of consumers say they prefer to buy from firms that conserve energy and protect the environment, says a study by the non-profit Carbon Disclosure Project.

PFIZER,TAKING UP THE ISSUE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY,"WE HAVE come to an age where we must seriously consider our natural resources and take steps to use them wisely, therefore the contestants from this year's YFCU Group Debating Competition were asked to debate on the subject ""Renewable Energy is the only Option"" and create a well researched and structured team debate in their relevant heats.  183 members competed in 61 teams from all over Northern Ireland in a battle of wits for a place in the finals which will be held next March.  The subject proved very topical in some areas, as personal experiences were brought to the forefront of the debate and became the material for interesting arguments where members had strong feelings about lignite and the imposition of wind turbines.   Group Debating is a very valuable competition in the development of our members as it encourages them to carefully consider both sides of an argument and deliver clear reasons for their side of the motion.  It also encourages teamwork and confidence building. Therefore the YFCU would like to thank PFIZER for their generous sponsorship, for which the association and members are extremely grateful.[…]",2003,11,29.0
GENERAL ELECTRIC,Virgin Atlantic gives $8bn order to Boeing in fresh setback for Airbus,"Virgin Atlantic dealt a massive blow to Airbus yesterday by placing a jet order worth up to $8bn with its arch-rival, Boeing. […] Virgin also confirmed that it is joining with Boeing and the US engine manufacturer GENERAL ELECTRIC in a project to develop a new generation of bio-fuels to power future aircraft - a move that could cut their carbon footprint dramatically. The aim is to demonstrate the technology on a Boeing 747 jumbo next year. Jim McNerney, the Boeing chairman, said that a number of options were being looked at for producing the fuel, from soya beans and algae to grain and ""cellulosic"" crops such as prairie grass. Until now, it had not been thought feasible to produce eco-friendly aviation fuel, because conventional fuels such as ethanol freeze at altitudes higher than 15,000 feet. Sir Richard predicted a ""major breakthrough"" in the technology in the next two to three years, which could make bio-powered aircraft a commercial reality by the time its 787s start to be delivered in 2011. Virgin is planning new long-haul flights to Perth, Melbourne, Rio de Janeiro, Seattle, Vancouver and Bangkok. It currently operates 37 aircraft, so the latest order could double the size of the fleet. To date, Boeing has 544 orders worth $75bn from 44 customers for the 787, making it the most successful jet launch in commercial airline history. The plane enters service in 2008.",2007,4,25.0

Citi, JP Morgan Change and Morgan Stanley announced the formation of the ""carbon principles"" which offers climate change guidelines to advisers and lenders to power companies. The principles were formed in an effort to understand and evaluate carbon risk. It's increasingly likely that the United States will impose a cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, considered the leading cause of climate change. That could make coal, a cheap but high-carbon fuel, expensive to burn.[...]",2008,2,5.0
CHEVRON,No twig left behind; Old into new. Wood waste becomes bioenergy,"The future of Canada's forests may lie in applying new technologies to a very old use. Trees have long provided fuel and heat, but in this era of high oil prices and high public expectations about slowing climate change, wood-produced energy is attracting interest from researchers, investors and consumers. It even has a new name - bioenergy - and includes three main product lines: Biomass, which uses the wood waste from milling and logging operations to produce electricity and heat. Pellets, a wood product used in specially designed heating systems. Biofuels, which extract cellulosic ethanol from wood waste for use as an additive in gasoline and diesel fuel. […] David Godkin understands the value of wood waste. As general manager of P.E.I. Energy Systems, Godkin oversees a district heating system that provides heat to some of Prince Edward Island's largest buildings. […] The system began in the mid-1980s during what Godkin describes as a mini oil crisis. […] As demand for bioenergy increases, other energy sector players are coming to the table. In March, the CHEVRON oil company and the Weyerhaeuser forestry products firm announced an equal partnership in the creation of a new U.S. company, Catchlight Energy, which will develop cellulosic ethanol, using plant waste.",2008,4,22.0
