APPLE ,Tourists snap up British iPads to smuggle into China,"IT'S the digital version of the slow boat to China. The iPad 2, made in China but yet to go on sale there, is being bought in London and smuggled back into the country where it is manufactured.  It means the Apple tablet is creating extra carbon emissions as it travels halfway across the world and back again. Customers are queuing to buy the iPad 2 at Apple shops in London and send them 6,000 miles back to China. The tablets are bought for their retail price of £399 for a 16GB model and then taken to China, where they sell for £430. The profit is not in this small mark-up but in the 20% Vat - in this case almost £80 - Chinese tourists can reclaim when they take the iPads out of the country. No tax is paid to the Chinese authorities by the smugglers. It means a student who takes home six iPads can fund his trip to London. […]",negative,2011,4,17
CHEVRON,AFTER SEATTLE; Anarchists get organized.,"For Juliette Beck, it began with the story of the Ittu Oromo, Ethiopian nomads whose lives were destroyed, in vast numbers, by a dam-a hydroelectric project sponsored by the World Bank. Beck was a sophomore at Berkeley, taking a class in international rural development. The daughter of an orthopedic surgeon, she had gone to college planning to do premed, but environmental science caught her interest, and the story of the Ittu Oromo precipitated a change of major. […] Beck likes to call the I.M.F., the W.T.O., and the World Bank ""the iron triangle of corporate rule."" In her view, these institutions-their leaders, clients, political allies, and, above all, true bosses, multinational corporations-are frog-marching humanity, along with the rest of the planet, into a toxic, money-maddened, repressive future. And she intends to persuade the rest of us not to go quietly. […] Bank officials have consistently vowed to improve this record, to start funding projects that benefit not only big business and Third World elites but also the world's poor. Accordingly, projects with non-governmental organizations and other ""civil society"" groups, along with efforts to promote access to health care and education, have increased. But Bank contracts are worth millions, and multinational corporations have remained major beneficiaries. In 1995, Lawrence Summers, then an under-secretary at the Treasury Department-he is now its Secretary-told Congress that for each dollar the American government contributed to the World Bank, American corporations received $1.35 in procurement contracts. One of the Bank's major proposals at the moment is for the development of oilfields in Chad, in central Africa, and the construction of an oil pipeline running more than six hundred miles to the coast at Cameroon. The environmental impact of this pipeline is predicted by many to be dire, the benefits to the people in the area minimal. The big winners will, in all likelihood, be the Bank's major partners in the project-Exxon Mobil and CHEVRON. […]",negative,2000,4,17
Exxon Mobil,$10bn oil payout voided,"SAN FRANCISCO: An appeal court yesterday voided the $10 billion punitive damages imposed on Exxon Mobil Corporation for the 1989 Valdez oil spill which polluted the Alaskan coast.

CHEVRON,Minister's dash to save LNG deal,"Resources Minister Ian Macfarlane will fly out of the country tomorrow to head off an environmental backlash that threatens to delay $50 billion of liquefied natural gas exports to California. Mr Macfarlane will lobby on behalf of a number of Australian LNG producers, but a focus will be BHP Billiton's plan to establish a floating import terminal off the coast of California. While the $US600 million ($780 million) plan would help solve California's persistent energy problems, it has raised the hackles of the state's powerful environmental lobby. BHP Billiton's Cabrillo Port project would collect LNG shipments in a huge offshore storage tanker and convert them to gas, which would then be moved to the mainland through an ocean-floor pipeline. Local community groups are concerned not just about the effect an accident at the facility could have on the environment, but also the threat of a terrorist attack. As well as meeting members of California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's administration, Mr Macfarlane will hold discussions with green groups in the state and travel to Mexico, where he will sign an agreement on energy issues. With environmental concerns shaping up as an insuperable obstacle to exporting LNG directly into California, a number of companies are looking at the possibility of delivering natural gas to Mexico, which could then sell it across the border. Mexico last week gave the green light to two projects to establish gas-import terminals, including one by CHEVRONTEXACO, which is developing the Gorgon gas field off the West Australian coast. While Mr Macfarlane said he would promote Australia as a reliable and environmentally safe source of LNG, he also expected the federal government's close ties with the US should help his case.

Exxon Mobil,Exxon makes first big investment in biofuels,"Exxon Mobil Corp. said yesterday it will make its first major investment in greenhouse-gas reducing biofuels in a $600 million (U.S.) partnership with biotech company Synthetic Genomics Inc. to develop transportation fuels from algae. Despite record-breaking profits in recent years, the oil and gas giant has been criticized by environmental groups, politicians and even shareholders for not spending enough to explore alternative energy options. One of the company's requirements was finding a biofuel source that could be produced on a large scale. It says photosynthetic algae appears to be a viable, long-term candidate. If the alliance is successful, algae-based gasoline is still several years away and will mean additional, multibillion-dollar investments for mass production. Exxon's biofuels investment is tiny compared with the $29 billion it is spending this year to find new supplies of crude and natural gas.",negative,2009,7,15
Exxon Mobil,Rival oil companies get a taste of BP's medicine on Capitol Hill,"Members of Congress tore into the big energy corporations last night for filing almost identical Gulf of Mexico oil spill response plans - which included contact details for a deceased scientist and steps to protect a marine mammal not found in the region's waters. It was an astonishing and sustained verbal battering which undermined attempts by Shell, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil to suggest that their working practices differ from those of BP; and that the catastrophe would not have happened if the leaking well had been theirs. [...] An early BP document put the spill rate at between 1,000 and 14,000 barrels a day. A panel of US scientists offered grim news last night warning that the ""most likely flow rate of oil today"" ranges from 35,000 to 60,000 barrels per day - once more far higher than previously suggested.

Exxon Mobil,US regulator warns over Canada oil pipeline plan,"President Barack Obama became significantly more likely to block the Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL oil sands pipeline after the US environmental regulator said a government report that in effect endorsed the project was based on ""insufficient"" research. [...] However, the EPA has agreed with opponents of the pipeline, arguing that trains would not be able to carry anything like the amount of oil that Keystone could - so blocking it would feed through into lower carbon emissions. Cynthia Giles, from the EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, said the State Department's ""analysis should include further investigation of rail capacity and costs, recognising the potential for much higher per barrel rail shipment costs"". Ms Giles said the State Department needs to ""more clearly acknowledge"" the dangers of an oil spill from the pipe to the surrounding environment.

INTEL, Chips are down for Irish high-tech boom," Environmental objections to INTEL's plans for a huge expansion at a microprocessor plant are worrying the industry, writes Douglas Dalby.  INTEL'S blueprint for a E2billion (£1.4billion) expansion of its chip-manufacturing plant in Co Kildare, Ireland, threatens to split the local community and leave the Irish government's plans for inward investment in real trouble.  The heritage trust, An Taisce, the local planning alliance and a resident in the town of Leixlip have lodged objections to the project, known as Fab 24-2.[…] The organisation is concerned that there is no reference made to the European Union's Seveso directive, which is a mandatory emergency plan governing the prevention of chemical accidents. This includes fire services. […] INTEL has largely succeeded in cultivating a pristine image. Media photographs of the sprawling Leixlip plant invariably portray employees in white boiler suits involved in the production of the cutting-edge technology responsible for driving over 80% of the world's computers.

INTEL,"Environment, Social and Governance Supplement: Case Study: Technology Sector - Sustainable and responsible investing","[…]. That is to say, the issue is not only for public authorities concerned to reduce energy consumption, but is also reflected in a genuine competitive advantage on the market. For example, the recent success of the company AMD in the face of its powerful competitor INTEL is explained to a great degree by the technological progress it has made in dual-core microprocessors, which consume less energy while performing better.[…] The interest paid by some NGOs and by public authorities to the question of waste and hazardous substances is not recent. In 1989, the United Nations adopted the Basle Convention on the export of hazardous substances. Following that first international reference framework, national initiatives have succeeded one another, supported by a series of European directives from 2003 to ensure that waste management in the technology sector is fully taken in hand by producers and distributors. This ever more urgent regulation is leading companies in the sector to make provisions and to organise themselves differently. Waste management combined with the directives concerning hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment not only involves the introduction of recycling processes but also fundamental changes to manufacturing processes, underlying R&D expenditure, the review of product design and so on. In the technology sector, a research institute (AMR Research) has estimated that 2 per cent of companies' revenues in the sector should be allocated to meeting these standards. For its part, the European Commission has estimated a total cost of between E650m and E1.05bn per annum for the Europe of the 15. The impact may also be positive to the extent that companies that are innovative concerning respect for the environment may concentrate on increasing their market share by highlighting this competitive advantage. Dexia AM sustainability analysts believe that the importance of the management of waste and dangerous substances is reaching a peak in the sector. In the next five years, we think that the relevance of management of waste products reaching the end of their life cycle will be a constant issue for companies. On the other hand, it is anticipated that the question of hazardous substances in products will increase in relevance in the future, many companies still not having fully factored the consequences of the new legislation.",negative,2006,11,6

Exxon Mobil,My Say: The climate change revolution,"The world is in the midst of a great political transformation, in which climate change has moved to the centre of national and global politics. For politicians in persistent denial about the need to act, including US President George W Bush, Australian Prime Minister John Howard, and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, there is no longer any place to hide. The science is clear - man-made changes in climate are being felt, and the electorate's demand for action is growing. Though unlikely just a few months ago, a strong global agreement by 2010, one that will set a path for action for decades to come, now stands a good chance of being implemented. Political leaders in countries that produce coal, oil, and gas - like the US, Australia, and Canada - have pretended that climate change is a mere hypothesis. For several years, the Bush administration tried to hide the facts from the public, deleting references to man-made climate from government documents and even trying to suppress statements by leading government scientists.

What you have now is the president and...senior people in the government actually appearing with the plaintiffs and exhorting the court to not only finalize the litigation, but do it fast. From our standpoint this is now a considerably different kind of a situation and one in which we're being denied justice, the rule of law is being abandoned, the laws of Ecuador are being violated...we would like the international community, the legal community to understand that this has become a farce because as it moves forward we are going to defend ourselves in every conceivable forum and what we want to make sure is people understand why.

CHEVRON,Experts worry about cleanup of Arctic oil spills; Ice interferes with normal methods of purging oil after accidents,"As the world's energy industry begins a cautious return to Arctic waters, environmentalists, scientists and governments are increasingly concerned about its ability to clean up after the accidents some say will inevitably follow. ""There continues to be no effective method for cleaning up an oil spill on ice,"" said Samantha Smith, director of the World Wildlife Fund's Arctic program. […] Last March, a U.S. Arctic Research Commission report concluded that nearly all the techniques used to clean up oil spills in southern waters are useless or nearly so in the North. […] Industry is already moving. On Dec. 2, Devon Energy filed plans with the National Energy Board to drill the first offshore well in Canada's Beaufort Sea in 13 years. Although Devon will drill close enough to shore to be on stable ice, energy majors including Talisman, BP, Anadarko and CHEVRON also have multiyear exploration licences in the Beaufort, some of which are considerably further out. […] Ms. Smith points out that because the Arctic is a low-energy environment, it takes much longer for industrial impacts to fade. As well, Arctic marine species tend to concentrate in certain areas at certain times of the year. An accident in one of those places during the short summer growing season - also the easiest time of year for exploration - would be catastrophic, she said.

And it is the global cosmetic industry's use of 'dirty' oil that is partly to blame, reports Gethin Chamberlain in Rawa Tripa: FIGHT FOR EXISTENCE","Even in the first light of dawn in the Tripa swamp forest of Sumatra it is clear that something is terribly wrong. Where there should be lush foliage stretching away towards the horizon, there are only the skeletons of trees. Smoke drifts across a scene of devastation. Tripa is part of the Leuser Ecosystem, one of the world's most ecologically important rainforests and once home to its densest population of Sumatran orangutans. As recently as 1990, there were 60,000 hectares of swamp forest in Tripa: now just 10,000 remain, the rest grubbed up to make way for palm oil plantations servicing the needs of some of the world's biggest brands. Over the same period, the population of 2,000 orangutans has dwindled to just 200. […] ""One of the big issues is that we simply don't know where the palm oil used in products on UK supermarket shelves comes from. It may well be that it came from Tripa,"" says Usher. In October, the Rainforest Foundation UK singled out Superdrug and PROCTER and Gamble (particularly its Head and Shoulders, Pantene and Herbal Essences hair products) for criticism over the use of unsustainable palm oil. A traffic light system produced using the companies' responses to questions from the Ethical Consumer group also placed Imperial Leather, Original Source and Estee Lauder hair products in the red-light category. A separate report by Greenpeace, also issued in October into Sumatran palm oil production, accused PROCTER and Gamble and Mondelez International (formerly Kraft) of using ""dirty"" palm oil. The group called on the brands to recognise the environmental cost of ""irresponsible palm oil production"". According to the Rainforest Foundation's executive director, Simon Counsell, part of the problem is that even companies that do sign up to ethical schemes, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, cannot be certain that all the oil they receive is ethically produced because of the way oil from different plantations is mixed at processing plants. ""The smaller companies sell to bigger companies and it all gets mixed. Even those companies making some effort cannot be certain that what they are getting is what they have paid for,"" he said.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Evacuations Ordered Near Two Nuclear Plants After Warnings of Small Leaks,"WASHINGTON -- Japanese officials issued broad evacuation orders on Saturday for people living near two nuclear power plants whose cooling systems broke down as a result of the earthquake. The officials warned that small amounts of radioactive material were likely to leak from the plants. The power plants, known as Daiichi and Daini and operated by Tokyo Electric Power, experienced critical failures of the cooling systems after the plants were shut down, as they were during the quake. About 45,000 people were affected by the evacuation order at the Daiichi plant, where those living within a six-mile radius were told to leave. The evacuation of the second plant was for a one-mile radius because ''there is no sign that radiation has been emitted outside,'' an official said. Failure of the cooling systems allowed pressure to build up beyond the design capacity of the reactors. Small amounts of radioactive vapor were expected to be released into the atmosphere to prevent damage to the containment systems, safety officials said. They said that the levels of radiation were not large enough to threaten the health of people outside the plants, and that the evacuations had been ordered as a precaution. Nuclear safety officials focused initially on the Daiichi plant. But by Saturday morning Japan had declared states of emergency for five reactors at the two plants, an escalation that added to worries about the safety of nuclear facilities in the quake-prone Japanese islands. The Daiichi and Daini plants are 10 miles apart in Fukushima Prefecture, about 150 miles north of Tokyo and close to the quake's epicenter off the coast. The plants' problems were described as serious but were far short of a catastrophic emergency like the partial core meltdown that occurred at the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, Pa., in 1979. A Japanese nuclear safety panel said the radiation levels were 1,000 times above normal in a reactor control room at the Daiichi plant. Some radioactive material had also seeped outside, with radiation levels near the main gate measured at eight times normal, NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, quoted nuclear safety officials as saying. The safety officials said there was ''no immediate health hazard'' to residents from the leaks, which they described as ''minute,'' and people were urged to stay calm. […] With the steam-driven pump in operation, pressure valves on the reactor vessel would open automatically as pressure rose too high, or could be opened by operators. ''It's not like they have a breach; there's no broken pipe venting steam,'' said Margaret E. Harding, a nuclear safety consultant who managed a team at GENERAL ELECTRIC, the reactors' designer, that analyzed pressure buildup in reactor containments. ''You're getting pops of release valves for minutes, not hours, that take pressure back down.'' […] Daiichi, which is formally known as Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, was designed by GENERAL ELECTRIC and entered commercial service in 1971. It was probably equipped to function for some hours without emergency diesel generators, said David Lochbaum, who worked at three American reactor complexes that use G.E. technology.

INTEL,Go green while waiting for green products,"HAVE you ever thought that the information and communications technology (ICT) equipment that you use and throw away contribute to increasing energy consumption and e-waste every year? Well, the United Nations Environment Programme estimates that about 50 million tonnes of e-waste are generated worldwide each year at an annual rate of three to five per cent. Although we can't deny the benefits that ICT products bring about, their usage has placed a heavy burden on our natural resources.  The amount of water and energy used for producing these products is high, and the energy these products consume during their use is high, too. Realising the effects such products have on the environment, major ICT vendors are now moving towards producing what they term as ""green IT"". Research company Forrester Research says vendors like Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Dell, INTEL and Sun Microsystems are investing significant resources in their green initiatives such as energy-efficient servers, data centre power and cooling solutions, cleaner manufacturing and device recycling programmes. These solutions are said to use less energy, but produce the same computing power. On the consumer side, companies like Apple, HP and Dell are said to be in the process of producing green PCs, which are made from non-toxic materials, can run on low energy, and built to be taken apart. These new machines are also highly upgradable and have a longer life of up to eight years. Forrester Research points out that new environmentfriendly products may be slightly more expensive than regular products, but their total cost of ownership will be lower and in the long run its usage costs will be lower as well. These green products, however, will only be in real production in the next two or three years. For the time being, we as consumers can play our part. For example, we can practise refurbishing used equipment, or donating used IT equipment to schools, charities or emerging countries. By doing this, not only can we save our environment, but also play our part in helping our community.",negative,2007,6,11

JOHN Howard this week finally buried the concept that the federal Government will fund the relocation of the $6 billion Gorgon gas project away from Barrow Island. […] The Gorgon partners repeatedly have said it would cost more than $1 billion to relocate the project on the mainland or anywhere else. Barrow Island is a Class A nature reserve. The Gorgon gas development is being pursued by an unincorporated joint venture. CHEVRONTEXACO, with a four-sevenths interest, is the operator. Shell has a two-sevenths interest and Exxon Mobil a one-seventh interest. CHEVRONTEXACO is also the operator of the Barrow Island oil operation, which began pumping oil on the environmentally sensitive island more than 40 years ago. After giving the WA Government enforceable undertakings against the risk of environmental damage at Barrow, the Gorgon partners are not keen to reopen the debate on whether the project would be better off elsewhere.

CHEVRON,AGA fights to enlarge its market share ,"Gas. THE Australian Gas Association is taking off its gloves in the fight to win a greater market share for gas in power generation. AGA chief executive Peter Dalkin said there was concern natural gas's share of the primary energy market had plateaued in the past four years. He said the association ""had to decided to face fully impediments to industry"". A main platform of the association's new war machine will be the greenhouse issue. Electricity generation by gas, as opposed to coal or diesel, significantly reduced greenhouse emissions but the association had been ""pretty relaxed"" about the issue in the past, Mr Dalkin said. ASA chairman Grant King said a key industry forum -Change and Challenge for Australia's Gas Industry -to be held in Brisbane tomorrow -would mark the start of work on a new industry strategy to help ensure gas consumption growth. […] Nevertheless, a recent ABARE study concluded Australian energy consumption would be 6087 petajoules by 2015 compared with 4810 now.[…] A large portion of the growth assumes the go-ahead for CHEVRON's proposed $2.4 billion pipeline to link Papua New Guinea gas fields to Queensland. The proponents of the pipeline have said sufficient customers can be found to justify the pipeline but a go-ahead from Comalco for a proposed $1.5 billion alumina project in Gladstone would provide a significant boost to the project's development.",negative,1999,5,10

The company has been under heavy attack for its labor and environmental practices, bruising its brand in bluer quarters. A major image overhaul is under way, and a new logo is starting to appear across the United States. The military-style Wal-Mart star has given way to a yellow twinkle that punctuates a new message: This is a company that cares, with fast and friendly service and a fresh, innovative outlook, according to Linda Blakley, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman. Ms. Williams, of Wharton, said the softer Wal-Mart logo serves another purpose: to stand apart from the bright reds and louder typography of its main competitors, Kmart and Target.

Exxon Mobil,3 dominant oil firms split on global warming,"The U.S.-European rift on global warming extends to the world's three dominant oil companies.

EXXON MOBIL Corp., which has its headquarters in Irving, Texas, remains outside the campaign, arguing in newspaper advertisements and speeches for a more cautious approach. President Bush will argue for the approach that EXXON MOBIL prefers when he meets with European leaders today in Sweden. He will press for more research into climate change rather than setting levels immediately for pollutant reductions as the European Union wants to do. BP, Shell and EXXON all want the same thing: to make money while the use of their core products - oil and natural gas - is under attack as a likely cause of global warming. Burning oil and natural gas creates carbon dioxide, whether the purpose is to drive cars, power air conditioners, or illuminate rooms. Scientists label carbon dioxide a ""greenhouse gas"" because they believe its emission into the atmosphere contributes to the rise in the Earth's temperature known as global warming. The initial response of the oil industry was to question this theory, which defines EXXON MOBIL's approach to this day. The company says it views global warming and the ""potential"" for human-induced climate change seriously. But it opposes restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions without further research on the causes of climate change.[…] Reducing greenhouse-gas emissions makes good business sense when it results from cutting energy use and, therefore, a company's costs.

That led Hein to wonder whether any radioactive material had drifted over to the farm from the Hanford nuclear research site, which is only 145 miles west of the farm. Could that explain her husband's thyroid cancer and two daughters' thyroid disease? In 1986, after the U.S. government made public files documenting the secret releases of radioactive emissions from Hanford during World War II and the Cold War, Hein joined more than 2,300 other ""downwinders"" in the region in suing the companies that built and operated Hanford for the government during those years.

That is why Twitter users were so surprised a few weeks ago when a representative of ExxonMobil, the world's most valuable company, appeared to be tweeting away on the company's behalf about issues as diverse as proposed changes to US oil regulations and past environmental disasters. It swiftly emerged that ``Janet'', the ``community evangelist (sic) at ExxonMobil Corp'', had nothing whatsoever to do with the firm, despite her vigorous tweets in its defence (''@1WineDude, did you know that the Valdez spill wasn't even one of the top 10 worst spills in history'').[...] ",negative,2008,8,26
CHEVRON,India set to sign $12.5b contract for Gorgon gas,"India is expected to sign its single biggest trade deal with Australia within two months, once it finalises the terms of a $12.5 billion deal to buy liquefied natural gas from the controversial Gorgon gas project planned at Barrow Island. Fourteen months after Indian officials first revealed their hopes to buy gas from the $15 billion Gorgon development, Indian group Petronet LNG yesterday confirmed it was negotiating a 25-year contract to take 2.5 million tonnes of LNG from Gorgon annually. […] A spokesman for US energy giant CHEVRON, which manages the proposed 10 million tonnes a year LNG venture with a 50 per cent stake, said yesterday CHEVRON was not the seller, having already committed most of its share of output to customers in Japan. […] ExxonMobil, which holds the remaining 25 per cent stake in Gorgon, has long been viewed as the most likely supplier to Petronet, of which it also owns 10 per cent. ExxonMobil already supplies Petronet from its Rasgas LNG joint venture in Qatar.

The approval overturned a ruling by the Environmental Protection Authority that building the plant on Barrow Island posed too great a threat to the Pilbara population of the flatback turtle, as well as other plants and animals.

PEPSICO,Companies Weigh Federal Labels for Gene-Engineered Ingredients,"With Washington State on the verge of a ballot initiative that would require labeling of some foods containing genetically engineered ingredients and other states considering similar measures, some of the major food companies and Wal-Mart, the country's largest grocery store operator, have been discussing lobbying for a national labeling program. Executives from PEPSICO, ConAgra and about 20 other major food companies, as well as Wal-Mart and advocacy groups that favor labeling, attended a meeting in 1 in Washington convened by the Meridian Institute, which organizes discussions of major issues. The inclusion of Wal-Mart has buoyed hopes among labeling advocates that the big food companies will shift away from tactics like those used to defeat Proposition 37 in California last fall, when corporations spent more than $40 million to oppose the labeling of genetically modified foods. ''They spent an awful lot of money in California -- talk about a lack of return on investment,'' said Gary Hirshberg, co-chairman of the Just Label It campaign, which advocates national labeling, and chairman of Stonyfield, an organic dairy company. Instead of quelling the demand for labeling, the defeat of the California measure has spawned a ballot initiative in Washington State and legislative proposals in Connecticut, Vermont, New Mexico and Missouri, and a swelling consumer boycott of some organic or ''natural'' brands owned by major food companies.[…] For more than a decade, almost all processed foods in the United States -- like cereals, snacks and salad dressings -- have contained ingredients from plants with DNA that has been manipulated in a laboratory.

On the Baja coast of Mexico overlooking the Sea of Cortez, the Loreto Bay company is building 6,000 homes. Population shifts and the arrival of American buyers are putting unprecedented strain on Mexico's infrastructure in other beauty spots like the Yucatan peninsula, where fresh-water supplies are already threatened. Loreto intends to be different. All its electricity will be supplied by wind turbines and it plans to produce more drinking water than it consumes. One of the scheme's backers is CITIGROUP, the world's biggest financial-services company. The $3billion (£ 1.5billion) development is a small project for the banking colossus - Citi manages assets worth more than $2,000billion. But it is one of several greener investments that Citi is targeting as part of a multi-billion-dollar push into clean energy and alternative technologies, according to an announcement it made last week. Citi's chief executive Chuck Prince said the bank is committing $50billion to address both the risk and rewards of climate change - the largest-single commitment from any company to date.  [...] If it all sounds a bit too altruistic to be true, you would be right. Ultimately, the shade of green Citi is aiming for is that of the dollar bill, not that of Body Shop. Not everyone has been impressed. Privately, some bankers accuse Citi of jumping on the eco bandwagon to hide other woes and they argue that, as a percentage of Citi's total business, the investments are still small. Green groups say the investment is nonsensical given Citi's financing of big polluters such as oil companies and coal-fired power plants.

The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee debated a bill Wednesday that would phase out US use of the Edison-inspired bulb, which has been used to illuminate American homes and businesses for more than a century. There are currently about 4 billion incandescent lamps in use in the US, according to the Energy Department. The bill (S. 2017), which is sponsored by Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the committee's Democratic chairman, is driven by the fact that conventional incandescent bulbs use far more energy than advanced lighting devices. Bingaman's bill would require companies such as GENERAL ELECTRIC, Philips and Siemens to gradually stop selling 40-, 60-, 75- and 100-watt incandescent bulbs in the US. Instead, under the measure, companies would have to sell only compact fluorescent bulbs, halogen bulbs, light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, and other types of lights that use less energy. Bingaman said that when fully implemented, his bill would save some 88 billion kWh of electricity per year. That would save American consumers about $6 billion a year in electricity costs, Bingaman said.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,South Africa; Nuclear Power Will Lead to Economic Ruin,"The technocrats are on the ascent and nuclear power is yet again on the cards for South Africa. How has the moratorium of 2008 been reversed? How can nuclear power, which was then considered an unaffordable option, suddenly have become affordable again? This is a story with many twists and turns. The nuclear lobby is, like any major industry, well resourced. It has consistently managed to project positions, which appear logical and reasonable - that nuclear power is safe, reduces greenhouse emissions and is reliable. It also claims nuclear power should be an integral part of the mix of energy generation systems, especially in light of global warming because it emits less CO2 than fossil fuel sources. Nuclear is easy to justify against coal power, the worlds dominant and most dangerous power source. Coal releases vast amounts of noxious gases releasing mercury and creating acid rain and global warming. Mining coal is environmentally damaging and dangerous.  But when we consider nuclear power we must figure its affordability against a full suite of alternatives. For starters, let's take fossil fuel power generation off the table. That is so yesterday, it has to go. Sustainable energy is rapidly becoming competitive. Wind and solar power can already compete directly with fossil fuels and nuclear power. The game-changer in sustainable energy in South Africa could be energy from ocean currents, tapping into our constant 5 kph (kilometers per hour) ocean river, the Aghulas current that runs down our East Coast. This can provide the elusive holy grail of sustainable energy - a constant base load electricity supply. All we need to provide is the plant - the fuel is free. There are other sustainable energy base load options. Concentrated solar is one, solar chimneys another. Wave power has huge potential. Heat conversion and capture from ocean themoclines and deep mines is also attractive. While nuclear is presented as a safe, mature industry, appearances are deceptive. First, the full cost accounting for nuclear remains vague. Each nuclear site must be cared for up to a century after ceasing operation. Decommissioning, maintenance, waste management and storage, along with a raft of other hidden costs are generally excluded in initial cost estimates. The true costs of decommissioning nuclear power stations is constantly rising, exemplified by experience in the UK where estimated decommissioning costs exceed GBP 73 billion (R788bn). […] Some nuclear supporters masquerade as objective overseers of the industry. The International Atomic Energy Agency not only regulates, but also actively pursues the interests of the nuclear industry. Major industrial groups like GENERAL ELECTRIC, Westinghouse and Alstrom overtly promote nuclear power through direct lobbying. The industry has a lengthy track record of underhand lobbying tactics and power plays, which place it firmly in the same league as the chemical or arms industries. […]",negative,2011,7,13

[…] According to Prof. Elegba, oil exploration companies in the country are in the habit of dumping their nuclear wastes haphazardly to the detriment of the environment. He alleged that some of them would even leave nuclear wastes arising from their production activities in abandoned oil wells. […] He, however, welcomed the professed readiness of CHEVRON to abide by the new regime, saying that the American oil giant had recently advertised for oil service companies that would supply it with radioactive materials. That action, he said, would put the nuclear materials used by the company under better analysis.

Zeina Alhajj, campaign co-ordinator for Greenpeace, said: ""The iPhone is a unique product and for us it is a missed opportunity for Apple to combine the innovation of the product with a green performance.""  The campaign was announced as Apple and its UK partners, O2 and Carphone Warehouse, outlined ambitious sales targets for the iPhone, which is Apple's first foray into the mobile market.

INTERNATIONAL BUS.MCHS.,CAN GREEN COMPUTERS HELP SAVE THE WORLD?; Computer makers are waking up to the fact that their products emit as much CO2 as aviation. By Nic Fildes; Business analysis,"The drive to make computers more environmentally friendly has been given an extra boost after the technology giants Google and Intel joined the rush to prove their green credentials.The move was widely welcomed by environmental groups. But analysts argued that the move was motivated by regulation and the need to reduce costs and that more needs to be done to reduce the total carbon footprint of electronic devices during production and disposal processes.Debates over reducing carbon emissions usually focus on sectors such as aviation and motoring, where pollution from vehicles has had a visible impact on the environment. However, research firm Gartner shows that the IT industry, excluding consumer electronics devices such as DVD and CD players, accounts for roughly 2 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions - roughly the same as the stigmatised airline industry.With awareness growing that computers are playing a big part in global warming, it was no surprise that Google and Intel joined the likes of Dell Computer, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Microsoft in making carbon reduction a priority. The two technology giants signed up to the Climate Savers Computing Initiative, which is backed by the World Wildlife Fund, with the goal of ""setting aggressive new targets for energy efficient computers and components […] The situation has been greeted with alarm in some quarters, with talk of an impending energy crisis unless something is done to reduce power consumption.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,"Dredging the Upper Hudson River, Without Slinging the Mud ","A lot of people along this stretch of the Hudson River see Saratoga Springs, 10 miles west and a few dollars up on the economic scale, as a place with its nose in the air. So when word got out this spring that the federal Environmental Protection Agency had chosen Saratoga Springs for its upstate field office -- the staging area for its long-delayed program to dredge the Hudson of its PCB pollution -- the reaction was swift. A Fort Edward newspaper published a cartoon showing E.P.A. workers in biohazard suits sipping Champagne at a lawn party with the horse-and-pearls set.   The E.P.A., many people said, had struck a tone-deaf note in its first decision after more than 20 years of study, revealing how little had been learned about the river and its people. The government promptly surrendered. Contractors are now working double shifts renovating a building in Fort Edward, not far from the most polluted areas. The office will open in May, two months behind schedule.  ""Nobody other than us thought it was a good idea,"" said Richard Caspe, an E.P.A. program director who will oversee the cleanup. Mr. Caspe said the Saratoga Springs site was chosen because it was in move-in condition and close to the New York State Thruway, not because it was nice. ""So you live and you learn. We're big enough people that we're willing to live and learn."" The stumble may well be forgotten on a project that lasts 10 years or longer. But many people here and within the E.P.A. say that as a first step it also set the tone of what will be one of the largest industrial cleanups in United States history. The issues of engineering, transportation and hydrology are expected to be daunting, environmental experts say. But the political and human dimensions -- especially the degree to which the government has pledged to involve the community in planning and decision-making -- are likely to be just as crucial to the project's success or failure. And hanging over everything is the heavy hand of history. Many residents here, and some scientists within the E.P.A., have lived the battle of the Hudson PCB's for much of their adult lives and careers, ever since 1976, when Congress banned all sale or use of the chemicals as evidence grew about its human health effects and impact on wildlife.  From the first studies to track down the estimated 1.3 million pounds of PCB's that were spilled or discharged from the General Electric Company's factories in Fort Edward and in nearby Hudson Falls, through the subsequent political battles that raged from Albany to Washington about proposed remedies, positions became hardened and entrenched. General Electric spent millions of dollars on scientific studies and advertisements arguing that sediment had entombed the chemicals, insulating them from the recovering life of the river. Mr. Caspe and other E.P.A. officials acknowledged that errors and misstatements over the years had damaged the government's credibility. Opponents of dredging in Congress pushed for tighter controls and safeguards. The result, in the E.P.A.'s final ""record of decision"" issued this year, was a document that mixes equal parts science and sociology. […] ""I guess maybe it's the first time that we can actually say that E.P.A. went in a different direction because of the stance the upper river community has taken,"" said Ms. Pulver, referring to the abandonment of the Saratoga Springs plan.

Kaul, the longtime chief of the Division of Water at the State Department of Environmental Conservation, said his job in the new office would officially be to provide information to the community about every step in the cleanup process.

CHEVRON,Plans for ultradeep oil well off Newfoundland sparks safety fears,"The Canadian subsidiary of an American petroleum giant is preparing to drill one of the deepest offshore oil wells in the world off the coast of Newfoundland - amid fears there are not enough safeguards to stop a mass spill like the one in the Gulf of Mexico.CHEVRON Canada is deploying a rig 400 kilometres northeast of St. John's to drill 2,600 metres below the ocean surface in search of crude. The well, located in an area known as the Orphan Basin, would be almost a kilometre deeper than the one that has ruptured off the southern U.S. coast. The project comes as the Canadian government is talking tough about maintaining strict safety regulations on future offshore drilling in the Arctic. However, questions are arising over whether Ottawa is taking a strong enough stand on existing projects, particularly those on the East Coast. Like the Deepwater Horizon project in the Gulf of Mexico, which has been spewing thousands of barrels of oil a day since it ruptured April 20, the new well off the coast of Newfoundland is part of a new class of ultradeep projects that present difficult challenges in the event of a disaster.

The Justice Department said the civil penalty is the largest ever collected for a violation of storm-water runoff provisions in the Clean Water Act. The payment pales compared with Wal- Mart's annual sales of $256 billion.  Wal-Mart also agreed to adopt stronger controls at its sites, at a cost exceeding $60 million, Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency officials said at a press briefing in Washington.

If the Fairtrade Foundation label cut through the fog of commodities trading, a similar idea could do the same for corporate carbon emissions. Greeenstar, a young company formed by a team of dedicated environmentalists, is creating such a set of carbon rankings, which award up to five 'stars' to brands. They want consumers to be able to look up the carbon credentials of brands online in a range of sectors, perhaps downloading an app or scanning a bar code to access the information. […]  Much of the data used for Greeenstar's ratings, due to be launched in early 2012, is sourced from a remarkably successful corporate campaign aimed at investors, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).  It acts as a form of peer group pressure, challenging brands to disclose their emissions, and actions they may have taken to cut them, and then ranking them according to quality of disclosure.

[…] If I would have been allowed into Canada I would have given a speech pointing out that the oil industry is perhaps the world's single greatest climate culprit. Just five global corporations - BP-Amoco, Exxon-Mobil, Shell, Texaco and CHEVRON - produce oil that contributes some 10 per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions - by far the major global warming gas. In the speech I never gave, I was ready to tell my audience that the petroleum industry is also continuing to relentlessly destroy the health and well-being of local communities and ecosystems where profits from oil are to be found. Be it in the mangrove swamps of the Niger Delta, the far reaches of the Amazon basin, or the fragile environs of the Arctic, oil generates social and ecological havoc. […] Instead, I found myself being treated like a common criminal in what appears to have been a paranoid Canadian government effort to assert that Calgary was not to be another Seattle. Unfortunately, what happened to us was no isolated incident. Rather, it is part of an emerging pattern of harassment of activists protesting free trade and globalization.

WAL MART STORES,"Big-box history in the making; Accepting Wal-Mart's proposal for a green-friendly outlet in Vancouver could revolutionize the retail industry, GARY MASON writes"," In his examination of Vancouver's evolution from a scraggly town on the edge of the rain forest to a poster child of modern-day urbanism, author Lance Berelowitz suggests the city's success has, at times, had as much to do with historical happenstance as it has any carefully conceived plan. […] Wal-Mart estimates the green-friendly features will help cut energy use by 37 per cent, water use by 48 per cent and carbon dioxide emissions by 40 per cent. It will cost Wal-Mart $30-million, twice as much as it spends building a normal store.  Despite the company's response to Ms. Roberts's demands, there is still much opposition. Those who don't want the store claim it would hurt smaller local businesses, create traffic congestion and increase greenhouse emissions. Various surveys and studies undertaken by the company, city hall and others have shown that most of these concerns have no basis in fact - still, the plan could meet its death when council members vote.

FACEBOOK CLASS A,Campaign on to switch off FACEBOOK for Earth Hour; Toronto woman aims plea at founder Mark Zuckerberg,"How does a gal go about campaigning to shut down FACEBOOK in support of Earth Hour? On FACEBOOK, obviously. Toronto resident Angie Bird, 26, set up a FACEBOOK page to publicize her plea to the site's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg: switch off the 500-million user site and draw unprecedented awareness to the energy conservation initiative.  ""It's getting a lot of attention,"" says Zoe Caron, climate policy and advocacy specialist For World Wildlife Fund Canada. Bird had this message for Zuckerberg in a YouTube video posted to her page: ""Imagine you just changed your FACEBOOK status to 'Mark Zuckerberg just saved the world, LOL!' "" Earth Hour is an environmental initiative started in 2007 in Australia - where Bird is originally from - aimed at convincing people to power off in support of lowering carbon emissions, the primary cause of climate change. In 2009, 88 countries participated and the CN Tower switched off its lights. Last year, 128 countries signed up.[…] FACEBOOK's press team has not responded - yet - to Bird's campaign, and didn't answer requests for comment from the Star. But the World Wildlife Fund, which organizes Earth Hour, has lent Bird support from chapters as distant as Denmark and India. WWF Canada wants to bring her on board as a volunteer, says Caron.[…] Though Bird decided to focus on FACEBOOK because she thought it could reach the largest audience, the site has in the past come under fire for its own emissions.

CITIGROUP,It's not easy being green,"Ilyse Hogue brought Sandy Weill to the negotiating table in April 2003 and persuaded CITIGROUP Inc. to take responsibility for the environmental consequences of its loans. Now she is trying to get 10 other major financial institutions to follow the megabank's lead. Hogue, 34, is the director of the global finance campaign for Rainforest Action Network. The campaign is trying to stop major banks, investment houses and insurance companies from financing projects that hurt the environment, particularly rain forests. Hogue is currently negotiating with Bank of America, Goldman, Sachs & Co., John Hancock Financial Services Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., SunTrust Banks, U.S. Bancorp, Wachovia Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. If they don't agree by Earth Day (April 22) to the same environmental principles that CITIGROUP now supports, she says that she will revive some of the publicity tactics, including protest marches, that worked with CITIGROUP. […] In her new job, Hogue decided to focus on CITIGROUP. The bank was financing companies and projects that she says were either mining, logging or producing fossil fuels irresponsibly. It was also an appealing target for Hogue because Citi, she knew, was an industry leader. At the time, CITIGROUP was the finance adviser for the Camisea gas project in Peru, which called for drilling in an area the Smithsonian deemed as one of world's most biologically diverse and pristine. The initial exploration killed half of the Nahua tribe by introducing influenza and whopping cough, according to the Rainforest Action Network. The bank is no longer funding the Camisea project. Hogue approached CITIGROUP in April 2000, but the bank failed to change its policies, so Hogue took to the streets. She organized protest marches aimed at Citi, one of which was held in Los Angeles in 8 2000, in the midst of the Democratic Party's national convention. ""It was early in the campaign, but from the level of enthusiasm I realized we struck a nerve,"" Hogue says. Over the next three years, she launched more creative approaches. During the holiday season carolers arrived at CITIGROUP's global headquarters on New York's Park Avenue to sing parodies of Christmas carols, such as ""Oil Weills"" to the tune of Jingle Bells. On Valentine's Day, Weill received hundreds of cards, asking him to show a little love for the planet. Large banners were hung across the street from CITIGROUP's headquarters mocking the bank's Live Richly marketing campaign, saying, ""Global destruction and global warming, we're banking on it.""In April 2003, three years after the initial negotiations failed, CITIGROUP relented. Weill himself came to the negotiating table, and the bank agreed to a new environmental initiative, publicly accepting responsibility for the environmental consequences of its loans. ""Sandy Weill was concerned about his legacy, so we were able to appeal directly to him,"" says Hogue, adding that Weill was not ""educated"" about these issues, but once they got his attention, he was interested in doing the right thing.",negative,2004,3,8

The first challenge to cloth nappies was imported from Sweden to the United States by Johnson & Johnson in the 1940s. But it was Pampers, devised by Mills's team and introduced by PROCTER & GAMBLE in 1961, that ended the dominance of the cloth variety.

CHEVRON,South Africa; Oil-Refining Capacity Still Tight,"NEWS that energy giant CHEVRON may sell two of its refineries to focus on the Asia-Pacific market can only strengthen the impression that downstream assets such as refineries are being neglected as independent oil companies restructure their assets. Inadequate refining capacity poses a serious threat to security of supply.  It is little wonder that various governments have gone to greats lengths to ensure investment in refineries. The snag, however, is the cost of the exercise, as refineries are not cheap to set up. Several African countries have announced plans to lure investors who will revive their ailing oil-refining sectors. Nigeria is one which has been grappling with problematic oil refineries. [...] The Nigerian government's efforts to give the oil refining sector a new lease on life have included privatising it. However, there has not been a big rush by oil companies or the oil majors - to be specific - to invest in refineries. One of the reasons given for the lack of refinery investment is poor financial return. Strict environmental rules have also been blamed for a lack of investment in the US and Europe. The US - the world's biggest economy - has not built a new refinery since 1976. The move towards cleaner fuels requires owners of existing refineries to modernise and upgrade their assets if they are to remain globally competitive. Energy analyst Cornelis van der Waal of Frost & Sullivan says oil companies with refineries in SA will have to make investments in preparation for the introduction of new fuel emission standards, known as the Euro 4, by 2012. The new standards will require either the construction of new refineries or the upgrading of existing ones. Companies are likely to opt to refurbish existing facilities. [...] In SA, where security of supply is a great concern, the oil industry will be under pressure to upgrade its refineries. The switch to cleaner fuels led to fuel supply disruptions in 2005 as the petroleum industry had to modify its refineries. [...] Recent comments by CHEVRON executive John Watson about the company's intentions for its refineries have fuelled speculation about the fate of the company's refinery at Milnerton in Cape Town. [...] Mkhize says the quest for financial sustainability has independent oil companies eyeing the more lucrative upstream activities, namely the search, recovery and production of crude oil and natural gas.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Underwater Line Is Wet Kiss for U.S. Supply,"Independent transmission developers in both the northeastern and northwestern U.S. looking to bring Canada's renewable electricity resources to power-hungry regions south of the border are installing hundreds of miles of line by using the path of least resistance--underwater. «There's a trend toward acceptance of this technology and this market,» says Christer Erikkson, director of business development at ABB Power Systems, a division of ABB Group, Zurich, Switzerland. The firm is one of the major manufacturers for high-voltage, direct- current (HVDC) lines and converter stations. «It's easier to lay a cable underwater, and it's generally better accepted because it's out of sight, out of mind,» he adds, noting that in some cases, an underwater cable is the only option. […] Unlike alternating-current (AC) lines, direct-current lines must have expensive converters at each end to convert the power. However, DC lines can carry electricity an almost infinite distance without losing much, if any, of the current, making them ideal to carry large loads of electricity over long distances. AC lines cannot carry power farther than about 40 miles, says Steve Eckroad, superconductivity program manager at Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, Calif. The Champlain-Hudson would be almost a direct line from new hydroelectric power and other renewable sources in upper Quebec and upstate New York to metropolitan areas. The cable would begin in the Richelieu River in Quebec and then travel south through Lake Champlain and along railroad rights-of-way, avoiding environmentally sensitive areas such as the GENERAL ELECTRIC Co. PCB cleanup site in the upper Hudson River. The cable would enter the Hudson River south of Albany and deliver power to converter stations in Yonkers, N.Y., and Bridgeport, Conn. Jessome says Transmission Developers is still in discussions with HVDC providers and contractors but has completed engineering studies of the route. Installing the cable would require use of a highly specialized boat that can carry about 60 miles of cables. Using global positioning systems and thrusters, the ship is able to lay the cable within 1 meter along the route. A special water jet, or water plow, digs a trench ranging from 3 ft to 6 ft to lay the line, which must be buried deep enough to avoid colliding with an anchor. […]",negative,2010,4,5

CHEVRON,Nigeria; Fresh Alarm Over $400m West African Gas Project,"Lagos - The Environmental Rights Action (ERA) group, a non-governmental organisation concerned with environmental protection, has raised fresh alarm over the proposed $400 million West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP) project. Which is expected to transport natural gas from Nigeria to choice consumers in Benin Republic, Togo and Ghana. In a recent booklet titled: ""PIPE Dream. The West African Gas Pipeline Project and the Environment"", ERA stated that environmental degradation of monumental proportion will hit the entire West African sub-region, should the WAGP project as presently conceived, be allowed to continue. Aside from fear of possible environmental degradation, ERA further contended that the project, would lead to escalation of communal conflicts and the dislocation of local communities. […] Citing the 1995 World Bank report which indicated that claims made by oil companies that gas projects would eliminate flaring were made to deceive the people, ERA said: ""Without any clear plan of eliminating flaring of associated gas, CHEVRON is attempting to deceive the world into believing that the West African Gas pipeline will result in the immediate reduction of gas flaring."" […] The WAGP projected is being floated by a consortium comprising CHEVRON Nigeria Limited (CNL), Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Shell Petroleum Development Corporation (SPDC), Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), Societe Togolaise de Gaz (SOTOGAS) and Societe Benioise de Gaz S.A.

His trip is ""a day late and a dollar short"" as far as making a positive difference is concerned. He is supposed to announce new multi-year spending plans for supporting development in Africa that the White House has crafted using Arthur Andersen-style accounting methods (i.e. counting old money several times and using projections for sums that don't yet exist). Arriving after all the major issues have already been addressed, he will mainly defend the U.S. opposition to setting goals and time frames for achieving progress on most environmental and developmental matters by falsely suggesting that the U.S. is leading the world in support for sustainable development. […] Secretary Powell is attending only the final two days of the summit. He is representing President Bush, who refused to attend the summit. Last year Bush prevented Powell, the first African American Secretary of State, from even attending the World Conference Against Racism also hosted by South Africa. […] Powell's decision not to visit Nigeria, the most important African country, may have been influenced by the hundreds of Nigerian women that recently took over several oil platforms of CHEVRON/Texaco to protest their exploitation of Nigerian resources and pollution of the environment while failing to invest in the development of local communities.

CHEVRON,Gore's oil pledge,"Vice President Al Gore says that as president he would do all that he could to block oil drilling off the coasts of Florida and California. […] Vice President Al Gore has built a political career partly on his reputation as a staunch environmentalist. But until recently he equivocated on an issue that should be fundamental to his green philosophy: offshore drilling for oil and gas. In a speech last week, Gore finally broke his silence. A Gore administration, he pledged, would do everything it could to block all drilling off Florida and California.  Until his campaign speech Thursday, Gore had been conspicuously vague on the drilling question. As the debate raged over whether the U.S. Commerce Department - an agency that falls under Gore and President Clinton - should allow CHEVRON USA to drill for gas off the Florida Gulf Coast, the vice president said a law prohibited him from taking a position. Gore did not exactly address the CHEVRON question head-on, but his call for an all-out ban on granting new leases and acting on existing ones clearly covers it. ""I will take the most sweeping steps in our history to protect our oceans and coastal waters from offshore oil drilling,"" Gore said. […] Gov. Jeb Bush, who raised money from oil interests during last year's elections, has acknowledged where public sentiment lies and staked out a strong anti-drilling position in his administration.

Bush, who pushed for many of the policy goals in his presidential campaigns. […] ""This couldn't have come at a more crucial time,"" said Tom Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute. […] Mr. Kuhn said members of his organization - including utilities that produce 75 per cent of the nation's electricity - ""are really happy"" with the bill, which includes $11.5-billion (U.S.) in tax incentives and policy measures to improve investment in the power grid, develop nuclear and clean coal-fired power plants, and help utilities buy pollution-control equipment. The bill provides mandatory standards for operating the nation's power grid, a measure designed to prevent the spread of blackouts. U.S. lawmakers dealt a blow to the bid by China National Offshore Oil Corp. to acquire Unocal Corp. by adding wording that would require a 120-day review of China's growing energy demands before any CNOOC deal could close. This study is in addition to Washington's planned national security review of a CNOOC acquisition and would further impair the Chinese company's ability to close a deal. By delaying the close of any deal with CNOOC, the move by Congress would make the Chinese company's offer significantly less attractive to Unocal investors - and so give a boost to the competing bid from CHEVRON Corp., which could close in weeks. Representatives of other energy producers, including oil, nuclear, coal and solar energy - along with ethanol-producing farmers - were pleased, too. A number of problems affecting these groups have evolved from a lack of federal energy policy.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,THE AD CAMPAIGN; McCall Criticized on Education,"     This is a new 30-second commercial released yesterday by Gov. George E. Pataki. In addition to this spot, which focuses on the record of the governor's Democratic opponent, H. Carl McCall, the Pataki campaign re-released an older advertisement emphasizing the environment, health care and education. Both ads will be broadcast downstate. […] ACCURACY: One-sided. The environmental votes referred to mostly involved shareholder resolutions aimed at forcing companies to adopt Ceres, a set of environmental standards. No proxy votes have resulted in a victory for Ceres, at any company, and the New York City Pension Fund is the only large public pension fund that routinely votes in favor of such social issues. Mr. McCall has said that his duty as trustee of the New York State Pension Fund is one of fiduciary guardian, not social activist. But he also takes credit for using the millions of General Electric shares under his control to pressure that company into decontaminating the Hudson River of PCB's. The Pataki campaign's figures on education have also been challenged before. While over all the student-to-teacher ratio increased, the average class size in kindergarten through third grade, where researchers contend that smaller classes are most important, shrunk to 24.5 students from 25, and in grades four to six it went down to 28 from 30. Class size did increase slightly for middle and high school grades. SCORECARD: The governor goes after Mr. McCall by remote control. Upstate, Mr. McCall, according to Mr. Pataki, is a tax-and-spend liberal. Downstate, he is weak on Democratic basics like education and the environment. The problem with these attacks is that there is not much there there.

Exxon Mobil,Oil giant in environmental gun,"Environmental groups are gathering evidence for an unprecedented legal battle to pin part of the blame for global warming on a single company, Exxon Mobil.

The director of the London-based Climate Initiatives Fund, Simon Retallack, says research is under way to prove direct economic costs of the resulting rise in global temperature. […] The case against Exxon Mobil is based on two reports. The first, by a researcher at Colorado's Rocky Mountain Institute, added up all emissions by Exxon Mobil, its predecessor companies and their customers since their original ancestor, Standard Oil, was formed in 1882. It found that the company's main effect on global warming came from carbon dioxide emissions by customers who burned its oil. The company had a much smaller effect on global levels of another greenhouse gas, methane, and its effect on nitrogen oxide levels was ""negligible"". Niwa scientists Jim Salinger and Greg Bodeker then put these results into a global climate model and calculated that Exxon Mobil could be blamed for between 3.4 per cent and 3.7 per cent of the 0.6C rise in global temperatures since 1882. They said the company also accounted for about 2 per cent of the 8cm average rise in sea level in the same period. […]",negative,2004,2,18

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Hudson River Decision To Have Broad Impact," Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Christie Whitman's decision to go ahead with the dredging of the PCB-contaminated Hudson River bed will have massive ramifications for the nation's rivers and ports. It will also send potentially responsible parties for other large Superfund sites scrambling for cover as General Electric (GE) is forced to foot the $460-million cleanup bill. Under the EPA plan, GE will have to dredge 2.7 million cubic yards of sediment laced with 100,000 pounds of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls)""probable carcinogens""along a 40-mile stretch of the Hudson north of Albany, making it the largest hazardous waste cleanup in the history of the Superfund program  And that's likely to be just the beginning. The EPA is shifting its attention to the nation's biggest Superfund sites""those for which remediation costs would run to an average of $140 million. Contaminated sediments account for the majority of such ""megasites."" The total volume of contaminated sediments nationwide""covering a range of pollutants from oil to DDT""amounts to some 1.2 billion cubic yards. The shift in emphasis stems in part from complaints from small businesses that they've been carrying more than their share of the cost of Superfund cleanups. That's because the EPA has focused in recent years on cleaning landfill sites, where small businesses are identified as contributing polluters. The EPA has mostly finished its work on such common landfills, and in the megasites that remain, large manufacturing companies are often primarily responsible for the pollution that needs to be cleaned up.

The association's chief executive, Belinda Robinson, included the criticism of the Government policy in its submission to the Government's climate change review headed by Professor Ross Garnaut. The Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, promised during the election campaign to lift Australia's renewable energy, including solar, wind, geothermal and hydro power, from 2 per cent to 20 per cent by 2020, and the target would be mandatory. The aim is to try to reduce the country's soaring greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The target was strongly backed by environmental groups and the then chairman of the Clean Energy Council, the AGL chief executive, Paul Anthony, who has since resigned and returned to Britain. An association spokesman said it was not opposing policies to invest in renewable energy but raising concerns about the 20 per cent target, which will pressure energy companies to source their power from renewables.",negative,2008,4,29

MEND is an armed militia, drawn largely from the Ijaw, and fighting for the Ijaw right to self-determination, a fair share of the oil receipts, and environmental justice in the region. The militia came into existence last February. […] Militants, using explosives, destroyed several of the oil company's pipelines, flow stations, and loading platforms. Facilities of such other foreign oil companies as ENI and CHEVRON were also hit. […] Several Niger Delta activists including Asari Dokubo have indicated their desire to contest for public office in 2007, and that all they ask is for a level playing field that will enable them present their programmes and policies to the electorate in the Niger Delta. […] I am not saying that the participation of Asari Dokubo in politics will instantly transform the turbulent Niger Delta into a haven of peace. It took fifty years of uncontrolled oil production to reduce the region to the environmental and social mess it is today, and repair will take a while. But this journey can commence by beating enraged swords into ploughshares. […]",negative,2006,9,23

The list, which was compiled by Greenpeace and released in San Francisco yesterday, shows that the company relies heavily on highly polluting coal power at the sites that house its banks of servers. Greenpeace's report, How Dirty is Your Data?, reveals that the company's investment in a new North Carolina facility will triple its electricity consumption, equivalent to the electricity demand of 80,000 average American homes.

APPLE ,Apple condemned for consigning toxic computers to China,"Apple, the celebrated computer company, has been rated worst among major electronics firms for its environmental policies by the pressure group Greenpeace. In a new survey of 14 major companies, the manufacturer of the Mac, the Powerbook and the iPod was put bottom of the list for its policies on the elimination of toxic substances and recycling. It was an unaccustomed stain on the halo for the firm with the highest brand and repurchase loyalty of any computer manufacturer, a glittering reputation as a design leader, and a fan base as enthusiastic as any rock band's. Greenpeace charged that Apple ""scores badly on almost all criteria"" in a detailed survey of its environmental attitudes and practices, ranging from timetables for phasing out hazardous chemicals to the adoption of the precautionary principle. The ranking was made in the updated version of Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics, which was published yesterday on the Greenpeace International website.  When the guide was first published, last September, Apple was ranked 10th; now it is ranked 14th out of 14. In a surprise first place on the list was the Chinese PC maker Lenovo, which displaced Nokia. […] The background to the dispute between Greenpeace and Apple is the growing concern about the phenomenon of e waste - electrical and electronic goods which have come to the end of their lives. The production of all these devices, from computers and printers to CD players and mobile phones, is the fastest-growing sector in the manufacturing industry in the industrialised countries. The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that between 20 and 50 million tons of them are thrown away as obsolete every year - with potentially serious risks to human health and the environment. This is because they are classed as hazardous waste for the toxic chemicals they contain, and so are expensive to recycle properly. Instead, huge amounts are shipped (especially from the US) to China and India, where they are broken up for scrap, often by children, in dumps. Greenpeace is mounting a two-pronged campaign against what it says is an environmental disaster in the making by pressuring the manufacturers both to phase out the toxic chemicals inside the products, and to take responsibility for disposing of the products at the end of their lives by taking them back from customers and recycling them. […] But even more eye-catching is the bottom rating awarded to Apple which, says the group, ""having made no progress since the launch of the Guide in 8 2006, continues to languish in last place"". Greenpeace charges: ""Apple fails to embrace the precautionary principle, withholds its full list of regulated substances, and provides no timelines for eliminating toxic PVC and no commitment to phasing out all uses of brominated flame retardants. Apple performs poorly on product takeback and recycling, but it does report on the amounts of its electronic waste recycled.""

Exxon Mobil,A city tour that's ahead by a nose,"Brooklyn's Dumbo neighbourhood is famous for its visual treats: its art galleries and a magnificent view of the Brooklyn Bridge. But over the weekend, as part of the 11th-annual Art Under the Bridge festival, a pair of artists invited visitors to experience the area as Marcel Proust might urge if he were alive: with their eyes closed. The project's name? The Smelling Committee. It all began a few years ago when Michael McBean was doing research into the history of oil refining in the city and stumbled upon a reference to a band of citizens in 19th-century Brooklyn who were so traumatized by a persistent industrial stench that they took a boat ride up Newtown Creek to divine its source. Back then the five-kilometre creek, an east-to-west tributary which divides the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn, was home to so much industry that residents had to keep their windows shut through the summer months. In 1891 the volunteer members of the ad hoc Fifteenth Ward Smelling Committee put their paddles in the water and their noses in the air and went up river to discover that the worst stink came from John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil refinery. The refinery issue is still alive in Brooklyn because of a 17-million-gallon oil spill in the 1950s caused by ExxonMobil. The spill, which stretches for 55 acres along the shores of Newtown Creek, wasn't discovered until 1978; they're still cleaning it up.

APPLE ,Apple faces legal threat over 'toxic' iPhone,"* Environmental group demands 'green' changes * Challenge follows Greenpeace report Environmentalists have threatened to sue Apple if it does not make its iPhone a ""greener"" product or tell consumers of the toxins allegedly used in the device's manufacture. The Centre for Environmental Health (CEH), a campaign group based in Oakland, California, said that it would launch legal action in 60 days unless Apple took action.  The threat comes after a report by Greenpeace, the environmental group, which alleged that the iPhone contained dangerous levels of bromine, chlorine and phthalates chemicals used to increase the flexibility of plastic. […] The level of phthalate esters, a chemical linked to birth defects, in plastic coating of iPhone headphone wires is greater than that allowed in toys or childcare items sold in Europe, Greenpeace alleged. […] The campaigners' action may prove embarrassing for Al Gore, a member of Apple's board, who last week won the Nobel Peace Prize for his environmental work. Apple has sold more than a million iPhones since the device's launch this summer in the United States.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Legacy of Poison in Twice-Excavated Yards ,"Tom Harrington's backyard in Queensbury, N.Y., looks much as it used to, except for a few telltale signs: the maple tree is smaller, the swing set is in a different place, and the lawn has strange lines running through it, like a bad hair implant. Last fall, most of Mr. Harrington's yard was dug out and replaced by the State Department of Environmental Conservation, at depths up to 20 feet, because it was contaminated with PCB's. So were the yards of several of his neighbors in Queensbury, a blue-collar suburb of Glens Falls in Warren County. Decades ago, many local people, trying to make a little extra money, took apart PCB-laden electric capacitors to remove the copper inside and sell it. They let the chemicals drip into the soil, leaving future generations a toxic legacy.  Yesterday, two neighborhood residents filed the first of what their lawyer said would be more than 100 personal injury and property damage lawsuits against General Electric, which manufactured the capacitors until 1977 at its nearby plants in Fort Edward and Hudson Falls in Washington County. Many of the residents say they have skin eruptions and other health problems associated with PCB's. Several appeared yesterday at a news conference in Albany with Walter Hang, the director of an environmental group, Toxics Targeting, that has released a report on PCB contamination in the area. […] In 1999 the agency came back to do a routine check and found that the soil was still contaminated around seven homes, though the source was not clear, Ms. Meicht said. The levels varied from one part per million -- the state's minimum for a cleanup -- to 1,500 parts per million. Anything over 50 parts is classified as toxic waste. Again, the state's contractors dug out all the yards where they found the chemicals and filled them in with clean soil, Ms. Meicht said. Michael Mabb, whose yard next to Mr. Condon's was also dug out, said he thought the excavation stopped only because it was taking too long and was running over the budget. ""It was coming winter and they just wanted to get out of here,"" he said.  Mr. Mabb's wife, Penny, has scars and boils on her arms and legs that are consistent with high-level exposure to PCB's, said David Carpenter, a professor in the School of Public Health at the State University at Albany.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,The PCB War Heats Up,"The ecological recovery of the Hudson River is by now a well-documented success story. What was little more than a 350-mile-long sewer stretching from the Adirondacks to Manhattan's Battery has been transformed over 30 years into a river pulsing with life. There remains, however, one huge blot on this otherwise happy history -- the polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, that were discharged into the upper Hudson from two General Electric manufacturing plants in Fort Edward and Hudson Falls and that now lie on the river bottom. The compounds were banned 20 years ago, but enough escaped into the river to pose a potential cancer risk to humans who eat fish caught in the upper Hudson.  Under the Federal Superfund law, G.E. must clean the river of PCB's or find some way to neutralize them. The company has never denied its legal responsibility, but for two decades it has wrestled with state and Federal agencies over scientific questions involving the toxicity of the chemicals and the practical question of how best to purge the river. This struggle has now reached a new and more intense phase with the release last week of a report from the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, which has the authority to tell G.E. what to do. The report makes two key points, neither of them comforting to G.E. […] The E.P.A. regards this theory as improbable. Environmental groups, most vocally Scenic Hudson, see it as another smokescreen for G.E.'s endlessly resourceful environmental team.

CHEVRON,British oil disaster could cost taxpayer billions: MPs fear voluntary fund cannot cover clean-up bill Doubts over effectiveness of spill plans in North Sea,"British taxpayers could end up footing the clean-up bill from any major oil spill in UK waters because current rules allow companies to dodge their environmental responsibilities, according to MPs investigating BP's Gulf of Mexico disaster. The government ought to require companies to prove that they can pay out billions of pounds in clean-up costs before they are granted exploration and production licences, recommends the committee's final report, which is published today. It also points to ""serious doubts"" over whether companies' plans to respond to spills - by capping leaking wells and skimming oil from the sea surface - would work in the rough Atlantic waters off the west coast of Shetland. The report points to the ""limitations"" of the computer modelling used by oil companies to predict the long-term effects of spills at sea. Last month the Guardian obtained documents relating to the oil spill response plan of US firm CHEVRON which in October was given consent to drill off Shetland. It showed its modelling software could not simulate spills lasting more than 14 days without crashing. The Gulf of Mexico spill lasted almost three months.[...] The report also says that EU legislation obliging companies to meet their responsibilities over a spill is vague and inconsistent and ""unlikely to bring to account those responsible for environmental damage caused by an offshore incident such as happened in the Gulf of Mexico"". It adds that the government should work with the EU to draw up new legislation based on the ""polluter pays"" principle.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,PCB Cleanup May Include Less Dredging ,"With a decision imminent on dredging PCB's from the upper Hudson River, the Bush administration is seriously considering a plan to do a fraction of the dredging that the Clinton administration proposed last year, Democratic elected officials and environmentalists said today. Several of the people making that claim said they had heard it from people who had had contact with the office of Christie Whitman, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, who will make the decision. But none said they had learned of the plan directly from Mrs. Whitman's office.   Mrs. Whitman's office did not return two calls today seeking confirmation of the plan. She said last week that she would make a decision by the end of this week, and would send it to the Pataki administration for comment. ""It is our understanding that this plan is under serious consideration,"" Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer said. But when asked whom his sources were, he said, ""I will do everything I can not to edify you on that one."" In December, under President Bill Clinton, the E.P.A. proposed a clean-up plan whose centerpiece would be dredging 2.6 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment from the river at several ""hot spots"" about 40 miles north of here. The cost, estimated at $480 million, would be charged to General Electric, the company whose plants dumped polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, a class of cancer-causing chemicals, into the river legally from the 1940's to the 1970's. The plan said to be under consideration by Mrs. Whitman would address only the most contaminated site, a part of the river known as the Thompson Island Pool, near the town of Fort Edward. It would involve removal of about a half-million cubic yards of sediment -- considerably less in some versions of the plan -- and would cost $100 million or less. The results of that dredging would then undergo years of study before a decision was made on whether to proceed with more. G.E. has gone on a multimillion-dollar advertising and public relations campaign against the December E.P.A. plan, asserting that there are better ways to remove the contamination and that dredging would actually worsen matters. A spokesman said today that the company had no idea what Mrs. Whitman would do. […] Two United States representatives from the Hudson Valley, John E. Sweeney and Maurice D. Hinchey, both of whom have met recently on the issue with Mrs. Whitman, said they, too, were in the dark. Mr. Hinchey, a Democrat, supports December's more aggressive plan, while Mr. Sweeney, a Republican whose district includes the most contaminated stretches of the river, has been promoting a narrower dredging plan like the one said to be under consideration.  Several environmental groups called a news conference here today to attack the scaled-back dredging plan, and to pressure Mr. Pataki to take a strong stand against it. The governor did not say until late last year that he favored dredging. He has not, however, said whether he supports the December plan, or how much dredging he thinks is appropriate.

In the suit filed by its lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana, the plaintiff is accusing defendants of failing to address the impact of oil-related pollution and environmental damage on agriculture and fisheries; oil spills and waste materials polluting water used for drinking and other domestic purposes, and to enforce laws and regulations to protect the environment and prevent pollution.It is alleging that the defendants are individually and collectively responsible for serious violations of the right to an adequate standard of living, including the right to food, to work, to health, to water, to life and human dignity, to a clean and healthy environment; and to economic and social development of the people living in the region. [...]It added that the people of the oil-producing areas of the Niger Delta have suffered for decades from oil spills, which occur both on land and offshore.Citing specific cases, the SERAP stated that a culture of impunity had been reinforced for oil companies in the region because of a lack of any adequate sanctions for bad practice that damages human rights.",negative,2009,7,27
Exxon Mobil,A pro-business agenda is succeeding quickly,"Big business is riding a small wave of success in Congress these days, and corporate America may well thank seven of President Bush's judicial nominees.[…] On Wednesday, the Senate voted to allow EXXON MOBIL Corp. and other companies to tap into an estimated 6.3 billion barrels of oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which has been off limits to oil companies since 1980.

The campaign was led by activist group SumOfUs.org and the Rainforest Action Network coinciding with the launch of Pepsi's stevia drink- Pepsi True- which is sold exclusively on AMAZON. They inundated Pepsi True's page with hundreds of 1-star negative reviews, criticising the American drinks giant for its ""failure"" to commit to more sustainable palm oil policies. Searches for Pepsi True redirect users to AMAZON's homepage and the product has vanished from its catalogue entirely, effectively shutting its distribution channel. ""Pepsi can't hide from the destruction that it refuses to eliminate from its supply chain"" said Kaytee Riek, campaign director at SumOfUs. ""It could rise above its competitors and do the right thing, but instead it has relied on half measures."" She added: ""It remains to be seen whether Pepsi True will be reinstated on AMAZON, but one thing's for sure - when consumers can interact with brands in such an immediate and direct way, at least they'll have to rethink their policies first."" In May, Pepsi pledged it would only use palm oil from suppliers who are members of the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) by 2016, but environmentalist groups argue its policies don't go far enough to guarantee its supply chain will be free from deforestation and social conflict.

Given the politically incorrect public persona of former chief executive Lee Raymond, you have to wonder what he makes of this latest development. To be fair, however, after castigating the Kyoto treaty, Raymond subsequently softened his stance, admitting that global warming did need further study. But while he applauded voluntary curbs in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, he drew the line at mandating curbs through regulation; and he did little to move EXXON beyond its core business of bringing oil and gas to market. Given the environmental bashing EXXON has taken, it's little wonder that a post-Raymond EXXON might be trying to come across as a bit greener. The latest indication of a significant shift came from protracted comments on the risks posed by rising CO 2 emissions by Jaime Spellings, EXXON's general manager for corporate planning.[...]",negative,2006,12,18

[...] The outlook includes an assessment of how potential carbon-emission reduction policies will affect future energy demand and impact the fuel mix. Gardner admits that it is, however, hard to predict these policies. For example, Europe is going to levy a carbon tax, which will raise the prices of fossil fuels to levels that make the cost of renewable energy worthwhile for investment. Policies will also drive nations to switch to less carbon-intensive fuels such as natural gas, which can help meet growing electricity demand and help reduce power-generation emissions by up to 60 per cent versus coal.[...]",negative,2011,4,18

PEPSICO,Bottlemania; BOOKS/Nonfiction,"To paraphrase an old axiom: You don't buy water, you only rent it. So why did Americans spend nearly $11 billion on bottled water in 2006, when we could have guzzled tap water at up to about one ten-thousandth the cost? The facile answer is marketing, marketing and more marketing, but Elizabeth Royte goes much deeper into the drink in ''Bottlemania: How Water Went on Sale and Why We Bought It,'' streaming trends, cultural, economic, political and hydrological, into an engaging investigation of an unexpectedly murky substance. Partway through her undoctrinaire book, Royte, a lifelong fan of tap water, refills her old plastic water bottle, reflecting that ''what once seemed so simple and natural, a drink of water, is neither. All my preconceptions about this most basic of beverages have been queered.'' And by the end of the book she will have discarded the old plastic bottle too, but not the tap. […] Let's talk about those evil marketers. In 1987, Americans drank only 5.7 gallons, or 22.8 liters, of bottled water per person per year, but the cumulative impact of ad campaigns and the vision of Madonna fellating a bottle of Evian in ''Truth or Dare'' more than doubled consumption by 1997. In 2000 the chief executive of Quaker Oats bragged to analysts that ''the biggest enemy is tap water.'' By 2005, the enemy had become the consumer's bladder; and in 2006, PEPSI, which owns Aquafina, spent $20 million suggesting that Americans ''drink more water.'' That year we drank 27.6 gallons each at a rate of about a billion bottles a week. But marketing swings both ways. As quickly as bottled water became a symbol of healthy hyperindividualism a backlash turned it into the devil's drink. In 2006, the National Coalition of American Nuns came out against bottled water for the moral reason that life's essential resource should not be privatized. New numbers surfaced: each year the bottles themselves require 17 million barrels of oil to manufacture, and, one expert tells Royte, ''the total energy required for every bottle's production, transport and disposal is equivalent, on average, to filling that bottle a quarter of the way with oil.'' Mayors from San Francisco to New York suddenly became aware of the new symbolism of bottled water as a waste of taxpayer money, a diss of local tap water and a threat to the environment.

Exxon Mobil,Oil Industry Hesitates Over Moving Into Arctic Refuge ,"More than three decades ago, the world's largest energy companies led the charge to drill for oil on the North Slope of Alaska. But now, as the debate rages over opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, those same companies remain surprisingly silent. Drilling in the Arctic refuge, which has already been approved by the House, has become a touchstone issue for the Bush administration, and the issue promises to produce a nasty fight in the current debate over the energy bill in the Senate. Publicly, the biggest multinational petroleum companies, like EXXON MOBIL, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP and ChevronTexaco, back the Bush administration's assertion that developing the oil in the Arctic refuge is critical to the American economy. But privately, many large companies say the prospect, solely on business terms, is not terribly attractive. […] The fight over oil drilling in the refuge has flared in Congress every few years, and so far, opponents of drilling have kept the area off limits. Now, proponents of drilling smell the sharpest whiff of victory ever.[…] The battle centers on drilling on the coastal plain of the refuge, a narrow ribbon of land that stretches about 110 miles along the Beaufort Sea. Environmentalists and wildlife biologists say that in the summer, the coastal plain teems with caribou and millions of migratory birds. Drilling for oil there, they argue, would ruin one of the few pristine wilderness areas left on the planet.[…] Even without lawsuits by environmentalists, the earliest any oil from the wildlife refuge would make it to market is 2010, industry executives said.

PFIZER,Assisting the inquiry,"SIR - After reading your March 8 article 'Toxic sites could cost a bomb,' I felt it necessary to clarify factual errors within the piece. Firstly, Solutia Inc, of St Louis, Missouri, United States, filed for certain protections available under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in December 2003, which provides certain protections to companies while they attempt to reorganise their financial and business holdings. Solutia Inc is undergoing such reorganisation with a view to emerge this year. Solutia's UK subsidiary did not file for such bankruptcy protection. I would also like to clarify that Solutia is not part of the current Monsanto Company. The former Monsanto Company was renamed Pharmacia Corporation and ultimately merged with PFIZER Inc in 2003. Accordingly, the ownership of the businesses of the former Monsanto Company is complex due to changes in corporate ownership over the years. Solutia's corporate headquarters in St Louis can provide more details on the bankruptcy protection process and ownership changes.

Exxon Mobil,What's News,"Exxon Mobil Corp. said it plans to appeal a Louisiana appeals-court decision that held the oil giant liable for more than $100-million (U.S.) in damages in an environmental case. The court reduced an earlier award Thursday, trimming punitive damages awarded by a jury to $112-million from $1-billion, and leaving $56-million in compensatory damages unchanged. But Exxon Mobil, of Irving, Tex., insisted punitive damages weren't warranted and said the compensatory award exceeded cleanup costs. The case involves land leased by former Jefferson Parish district judge Joseph Grefer to Intracoastal Tubular Services Inc., a company contracted to clean and refurbish Exxon's pipes between the 1950s and 1992. Judge Grefer argued the oil industry knew since the 1930s that its pipes were filled with residue containing significant amounts of radium, a carcinogen, and Exxon said nothing in hopes of avoiding liability for cleanup costs.

PEPSICO,TALE OF TWO VISIONS; Behind the De Soto debacle,"Pinellas County's move to expand concessions at Fort De Soto Park died a sudden death last week after residents raised a full-throated outcry. The County Commission office was swamped with more than 1,000 telephone calls and e-mails within a week. Some commissioners said the outpouring topped any in memory. While the Fort De Soto plan shocked some, it was rooted in a yearslong effort to expand county park services and to open public land to moneymaking ventures that offset operating costs. ""It wasn't like we sat around one night and said, yeah, let's do this,"" said assistant county administrator Jake Stowers, after the commissioners' decision. ""It was a thought-out process. And quite honestly, I guess we misjudged some of the feeling in the community.""[…] By 6 2005, the county had assembled a master plan that Stowers said reflected comments from the workshops. The plan called for ""energizing"" parks such as Fort De Soto with outdoor concerts, cafes and art exhibits.[…] Enlisting private companies to boost services at public parks is nothing new, said Paul Cozzie, Pinellas' parks and recreation director.[…] St. Petersburg environmentalist Lorraine Margeson helped rouse the opposition. She said the county failed to understand how precious unspoiled land in development-heavy Pinellas is to residents. Some plan advocates said embracing Hollywood's ideas would have little impact on the park, whose 1,136 acres are home to a beach ranked the best in the nation last year. Margeson finds that laughable. ""I'm sorry, but that is just such baloney,"" she said. ""These were not modest improvements."" The county is now negotiating with PEPSI, Pinellas' official soft drink, about expanding the number of soda machines at parks. The arrangement could be worth $3.2-million to the county over 10 years. Other than the PEPSI deal, county officials say there are no plans to allow private businesses to operate in parks. They are not backing away from the concept, however - the current concessions at Fort DeSoto will be offered for the time being - but officials say they will act cautiously after the Fort De Soto plan backlash.[…]",negative,2006,2,27

Each year, the farms produce millions of tons of palm oil, which has soared in popularity since the 1970s and is now found in foods like margarine, potato chips and chocolate, as well as in soap, cosmetics and biofuel. Palm produces more oil per hectare than other oil crops, making it a cheaper alternative. […] Last year, the British cosmetics company Lush introduced a soap made from a base free of palm oil. Last month, Cadbury New Zealand bowed to consumer pressure and reversed a decision to replace cocoa butter with palm oil in its chocolates.

In perhaps the biggest marketing coup since DeBeers convinced consumers that diamonds are the must-have gemstone for lovebirds, beverage companies have transformed water from a free, simple thirst-quencher into a colossal moneymaker.In fact, sales of bottled water have surpassed those of milk and beer, Elizabeth Royte writes in Bottlemania: How Water Went on Sale and Why We Bought It.  And although soft drinks are  still No.1, water isn't far behind. […] The ""green"" movement has raised Americans'  consciousness about carbon footprints and recycling. Water has become another green concern. Natural supplies of clean, fresh water  could dry up if we don't start paying attention to where water comes from, what we do to it and why we drink it.[…] In Bottlemania, she explores how water is accessed, packaged and sold; compares tap water with bottled water; and muses on the commodification of a natural resource. She raises questions about bottled water's surging sales and its impact on society and the environment -- and explains what she's learned in a straightforward, conversational voice that makes even the densest statistics and scientific explanations accessible (well, almost). Royte traveled to Fryeburg, Maine. An aquifer there is a source for Nestle-owned Poland Spring, which built a bottling plant in nearby Hollis. Fryeburg residents are at odds about whether they should welcome or shun the corporate interloper. Royte writes about Coca-Cola (Dasani) and PEPSICO (Aquafina).

COCA COLA,Tanzania; Inadequately Tested GMOs Are Sneaking Into Supermarkets and Being Sold As 'Food',"I CAN never be sure what my editors will do with an article I send in. They often help.

Last week they printed the caption of the photo: ""Deaths of female rats being fed with a diet partially consisting of GMO corn were linked mostly to large mammary tumors such as suffered by study participant 9255 GMO."" [...] Rats are a model for mammalian health and are thus helpful in modelling environmental risks for wildlife mammals. Ethically human experiments must be preceded by animal studies - knowing that rats are only a model; human reac-tions may be different. Moreover, previous research was at the most 90 day feeding trials, which is before the tumors even appeared in the research being reported.

WALT DISNEY,Response to Lantau green reports cool; People 'fail to see direct impact',"The two environmental reports on the DISNEY and North Lantau projects attracted only seven public submissions during a one-month consultation which ended on Tuesday. Environmentalists said the lukewarm response from the public might be related to the technical nature of the Environmental Impact Assessment reports, which total 3,000 pages. Ng Cho-nam, president of the Conservancy Association, criticised the Government for not taking the initiative to seek public opinion on large-scale strategic development.  Mr Ng, who is an associate professor of environmental management at Hong Kong University, said the public were not interested in studying the two assessments as they could not see the direct impact the projects would have on them. Among the 31 other environmental impact reports released for public consultation in the past, 19 received no response.  The remaining 12 received between one and 11 submissions. An Environmental Protection Department spokesman said the public consultation aimed to ensure transparency of the assessment process and they would study every comment in detail. The seven Disney-related submissions raised many questions over the findings of the reports, which concluded that the Disneyland theme park, due to open in 2005, should be able to comply with environmental laws. One submission was from the group, Hong Kong Dolphinwatch, which criticised the findings that there would be a limited impact on dolphins as ""misleading and inaccurate"". Another submission from a lecturer from the General Education Centre of the Polytechnic University, Dr John Babson, urged the Director of Environmental Protection not to issue environmental permits to the Disneyland project without a full assessment of the ecological and cultural heritage of Penny's Bay. A submission from the Citizens Party also criticised many of the Disneyland report's findings and statements as speculative and misleading. The department will decide whether to endorse the two assessment reports and issue permits after listening to the Advisory Council on the Environment, which will discuss the issues on Monday.",negative,2000,4,13
INTERNATIONAL BUS.MCHS.,"Green will be the colour of more data centres; Tech firms going green are offering more energy-efficient data centres, writes WINSTON CHAI","REDUCING the appetite of power-hungry data centres was a key focal point for enterprise networking and hardware makers this year as customers are becoming increasingly aware of the benefits of energy-efficiency on the environment and their own bottom lines. As the repository for critical business information and IT systems, data centres are typically packed with racks of servers, networking and storage equipment that are sapping electricity round-the-clock. To add to the consumption, such facilities often require special cooling systems to dissipate the heat generated by the towers of machinery, making them prime targets for power conservation.'The increased emphasis on green IT has propelled data centres to the limelight. With data centres consuming more energy than any other IT environment, both users and providers of technology have been placed under scrutiny,' said Tom Cheong, Cisco System's managing director of Singapore and Brunei. 'There is now an urgent need to review processes to ensure environmental sustainability, and the technology industry has been looked upon as the catalyst for this positive change by providing environmentally-friendly solutions,' he added. Against this backdrop, US authorities are even thinking of allocating energy ratings to IT equipment like servers. As a result, network equipment suppliers like Cisco, as well as firms like Sun, Hewlett-Packard (HP) and IBM have all released new products and services this year that promise to slash the electricity bills for their customers.[…] To add to the business opportunities presented by the eco-friendly IT movement, companies like HP, IBM and Cisco also have two major local government projects to look to boost local sales over the next 12 months.

Even by the end of October, the global bill for such natural disasters was estimated at  EUR 70 billion.[…] Three years earlier, a $ 7 million campaign by the American Petroleum Institute aimed to ""maximise the impact of scientific views consistent with ours"" (by recruiting sceptical scientists who dissent from the IPCC consensus) with a view to ""erecting a barrier against further efforts to impose Kyoto-like measures in the future"". Greenpeace produced its own assessment of Exxon's ""weapons of mass deception"" last October, with a foreword by Bianca Jagger complaining about ""powerful agents with vested interests who continue to wage a cynical, self-interested war"" to derail the Kyoto process.

PROCTER & GAMBLE,Oil burn causing slick in forests,"While showering a few weeks ago, I realised I had run out of conditioner. So I reached up and grabbed my wife's bottle Clairol Herbal Essences Rainforest Flowers, ""with essences of nourishing palm"". The label caught me slightly by surprise. As an environmental journalist, I've been writing about the ecologically destructive effect of palm oil for some time now. Whether it's used as an additive in soap, cosmetics or food, or processed into a biofuel, palm oil is one of the worst culprits in the climate crisis. Most of it comes from the disappearing, ultra-carbon-rich rain forests of Indonesia and Malaysia, of which around 65,000sqkm have been cleared and burned to make way for palm oil plantations.[…] Unfortunately, most of the food and cosmetics conglomerates are more interested in covering up the environmental destruction than replacing the problem ingredient. Kellogg's, Kraft Foods, Unilever, Nestle, PROCTER & GAMBLE and others (including the Girl Scouts) assure the public that such environmental concerns don't apply to them because they (or their suppliers) are members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, an industry group (with a handful of environmental members) that sets guidelines on growing and selling palm oil. Unfortunately, as a recent Greenpeace report revealed, the Roundtable's standards are almost meaningless because they don't include inspections of the palm oil tree plantations. The Roundtable plans to address this problem in the next few months by certifying a small amount of oil that it says has been verifiably produced according to some sustainable standards. But even Roundtable vice president Darrel Webber acknowledges that the process ""isn't perfect,"" in part because liquid oils are easy to mix and nearly impossible to track.[…]",negative,2008,5,23

The bad news for coffee farmers today is that the commodity market price of coffee has dropped more than 60 per cent in the past three years. This is due mostly to increased production from relatively new coffee producing countries that are flooding the market with cheaper beans. […] In nature, coffee grows best under shade. But it  can be grown quicker and more economically in open sun and with the assistance of copious amounts of insecticides and pesticides. This is how most coffee consumed in the western world is grown -- on plantations throughout the Third World producing for a handful of major trans-national corporations which control the coffee business: Nestle, Philip Morris and PROCTER AND GAMBLE prominent among them. According to analysis, the poisons do not make it into our cups, partly because the beans are so well protected by their natural outer coat and partly because harmful residue evaporates in the intense heat of roasting. But the environment, and workers using the poisons, don't escape so easily. Hundreds of workers have been poisoned, some have died, but according to aid agencies, the casualties are much higher because most cases go unreported.

For the past 15 years, 30,000 residents of the Ecuadorean Amazon have been fighting a legal battle against the CHEVRON oil company. The plaintiffs allege that, over the course of operations dating back to 1964, TEXACO (acquired by CHEVRON in a 2001 merger) dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste directly into the streams and rivers on which people rely for drinking, cooking, bathing and fishing. The dumping alone was 30 times more oil than was spilled in the Exxon Valdez disaster, with one crucial difference: while Exxon Valdez was an accident, the plaintiffs claim that TEXACO's dumping was a deliberate strategy to reduce costs [...] It is a troubled region - this month, Prince Charles visited Ecuador to highlight the damage done by climate change. The impact of the oil-drilling has been similarly devastating. Cancer rates have rocketed, blighting a region with little or no access to adequate medical care. There are high levels of leukaemia, miscarriage and birth defects. Five indigenous groups have lost 95 per cent of their ancestral land. In 2008, a court-appointed technical expert estimated that the contamination had caused 1,041 excess deaths from cancer. [...] The problems have been further exacerbated by the existence of 917 unlined waste pits, filled with toxic sludge, that allow millions of cubic metres of poisonous gas to escape into the atmosphere. Although TEXACO reached a $40m settlement agreement with the Ecuadorean government in 1995, in which the oil company agreed to clean up the well sites, the plaintiffs allege that the process was partial and inadequate.

The pipeline is being built by BP, whose chief executive, John Browne, sat on the board of Redland with Napier for several years. The WWF says the pipeline is an act of environmental vandalism that belies BP's claims to be the most green of the world's major oil companies.  'The pipeline goes through an area of Georgia that's of immense natural importance - it's like building a pipeline through the Malvern Hills.'  Indeed, from the WWF's description, the pipeline appears to be a foolhardy venture, passing through earthquake zones, revolution hot spots and disputed borders. In normal times it might be an absurd project, but these are not even normal times. 'It all comes down to American geopolitics. They wanted to reduce their dependence on Middle Eastern oil so they have turned the whole planning process upside down.'  The concerns could sound incongruous when they come from a man who lunches at the Reform Club, is wearing pinstripe suits, and has a house in well-heeled Sussex, but they don't.  The infrastructure for the pipeline is largely built. However, the battle is part of the larger campaign.

Igali also downplayed fears the surge in violence would force oil companies to evacuate more staff from the oil hubs of Port Harcourt and Warri. Shell was forced to pull out around 330 families from residential compounds in the Niger Delta early in 2006 when the militants first struck.

Exxon Mobil,FOREST'S GRIM FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL,"[…] This week Friends of the Earth will launch a campaign against the proposed pipeline and against the oil company behind the project, Exxon, which trades in the UK as Esso and Mobil. Environmentalists claim the pipeline, which will be the largest construction project in sub-Saharan Africa, will cause ""severe, irreversible environmental damage"" as it cuts through hundreds of miles of rainforest and several wildlife sanctuaries. The FOE campaign against the proposed pipeline coincides with the 10th anniversary of the Exxon Valdez oil spill. More than 10,000 square miles were affected when the oil tanker operated by the company ran aground, spilling 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound, Alaska. Kevin Dunion, chairman of FOE International, said that Exxon, which has applied for World Bank funding for the pipeline, has rarely shown any interest in the environmental consequences of its projects. ""Exxon exhibits the worst type of corporate irresponsibility.

But the utility expects soon to resolve the notice of violation, brought by the EPA last year, a PGE spokesman said last week.

Last year, the company earned $17.7 billion, or $4. 81 per share, on sales of $232.7 billion.  The meeting was marked by protests inside and outside the hall where the meeting was taking place. Activists urged EXXON MOBIL to adopt environmental and gay-rights proposals.  All were voted down, but supporters raised the threat of a boycott against the world's largest publicly owned oil company.  Activists also failed to get the company to promote renewable energy and to make a report on possible environmental damage from drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  The gay rights proposal was aimed at changing company policy to expressly forbid discrimination against gays and lesbians. Raymond said the company's current anti-bias policy is adequate, as it prohibits all forms of discrimination.  ""We will boycott your products, and we will not put a tiger in your tank,"" said British environmental activist Bianca Jagger, referring to a longtime EXXON advertising slogan.

The assessment was based on published information, a questionnaire and interviews.   Fair Pensions says it found a 'striking disparity' between the best and worst schemes - a dozen scored over 50% but 18 scored less (see table).  The Universities Superannuation Scheme, BT's pension fund and Scottish local council Strathclyde's scheme were ranked highest. Power company Eon, financial services firm Prudential and steelmaker Corus had the lowest-ranked schemes. The Coal Pension Trustees scheme and pensions funds for IBM, Unilever, BAE Systems and Lloyds TSB did not participate in the survey and publish little or no information on their approach to responsible investment Fair Pensions says a lack of transparency is 'often allied with ineffective policy'.

CITIGROUP,World banks club together to turn their notes green,"A new code of conduct provides stricter guidelines for projects in developing countries, writes Aaron Patrick in New York. Can banks make money protecting the environment and powerless communities? The world's largest financial institution thinks so, and is trying to use its financial muscle to reduce the damage from dams, power stations, mines and other infrastructure projects. CITIGROUP and nine other international banks this month adopted the Equator Principles, a code of conduct requiring them to follow standards laid down by the World Bank for infrastructure projects. Led by Chris Beale, an Australian who is CITIGROUP's head of project finance, the banks have vowed to cut off money to companies that break the rules, including independent studies for the most sensitive projects. The move follows environmental group criticism of banks for harming developing countries by funding destructive development projects. So far, only one Australian bank, Westpac, has signed on.[…] CITIGROUP and the other signatories provide about 30 per cent of the financing for the world's infrastructure projects and say they are prepared to withdraw money during construction if the rules are not followed. ""We will not provide loans directly to projects where the borrower will not, or is unable to, comply with our environmental and social policies and processes,"" the principles say. Environmental groups have welcomed the agreement but are cautious about how it will work. ""It is going to be really hard for a bank like CITIGROUP, which is really committed to make the Equator Principles work, when you have to question what these (other) banks' commitment is,"" Michelle Chan-Fishel, a program manager for Friends of the Earth, said. Among the first tests will be the $A4 billion Camisea natural gas project in Peru, which cuts through the Amazon rainforest. Friends of the Earth and other groups have asked CITIGROUP to withdraw its support for the two pipelines, wells and processing plant, which are slated to be built in a region with 198 species of bird per hectare, 118 varieties of fish and 152 plant species.

And it offers customers soy and organic milk as substitutes. […] There are two reasons why the protests against Starbucks are endless. First is its track record of giving in on nearly every demand.

[…]  PEPSI, Coca-Cola Co., Nestlé SA and others have been shrinking the weight of polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, bottles in recent years as public criticism of plastic bottles has grown. Environmental activists say plastic bottles create waste and increase consumption of oil, the basic ingredient. Last year, Nestlé introduced a 12.5-gram half-litre bottle for its Poland Spring, Deer Park, Ozarka and other brands. Coke has ""lightweighted"" its Dasani bottle. The moves also help companies reduce costs as they grapple with increased prices of commodities.

CHEVRON,Gas deal clinches PNG pipeline go-ahead / TROPICAL NORTH QUEENSLAND - A SPECIAL REPORT," Viability studies are imminent on a project of economic importance, writes  Stefanie Balogh BACKERS of the planned $3.7 billion Papua New Guinea-Queensland gas pipeline, which has now signed enough commitments to embark on its engineering viability study, claim that over the next decade it will provide the single biggest contribution to reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. […] The State Government estimates Queensland will become the fastest-growing gas market in Australia, with a four-fold increase in consumption over the next 10 years. […] The project was effectively given the green light in mid-8 when it secured its critical foundation customer base after Ergon Energy signed a preliminary agreement with the operators of the pipeline, CHEVRON Services Australia Pty Ltd. […] The agreement enables CHEVRON to proceed with a $94 million engineering study of the project. […] The PNG Gas Project's director, John Powell, says the significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will come because ""gas-fuelled cogeneration plants deliver a 75 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to a coal-fired station of the same size"".

CHEVRON,"Nigeria; Tales of Woes, Ruins, Destruction","Much of the landscape could qualify for Franz Fannon's description as the ""Wretched of the Earth"". Perhaps, no description could be more apt for this deprived enclave. Crops hardly yield there, a situation that has relegated farming to the background as a worthless enterprise. As a largely riverrine area, the inhabitants can hardly practice the pre-dominant occupation of fishing because the rivers are despoiled. The environment itself is no better. The cocktail of toxic substances, which has been emitted in the gas flares for over 40 years, including benzene and particulates, has exposed Niger Delta communities in Nigeria to health risks and property damage. ""It is shameful and indefencible stain on the reputation of western oil companies. The appalling waste of greenhouse gases in one of the world's poorest countries is a violation of the human rights of those subjected to the flaring. It is astonishing that it continues on such a scale when Nigerian regulations have prohibited the practice in general since 1984"". These were the words of Mr. Peter Roderick, coordinator of the Climate Justice Programme, when he came to Nigeria recently to support the coalition of Niger Delta communities, who have taken the legal recourse towards stopping gas flaring in the area.

It is also one of the leading regions in the growing field of biotechnology and genetic engineering. Genetic engineering has been in the news quite a bit lately, with the most recent attention focused on the trade battle forming between Europe and the United States concerning the sale of so-called genetically modified (GM) food.[…] The outspoken Mayor Brown is known for a certain amount of hyperbole, but nevertheless, Mission Bay could be an important development solidifying the Bay Area's leadership in biotechnology. Plans already call for UCSF to build a new research and teaching facility on the former 121.2 hectares railroad yard and industrial area. Brown and others then envision the surrounding area being developed as a biotechnology business park, capable of attracting the best talent from around the world. Several major European pharmaceutical companies have already expressed interest in locating in Mission Bay, and the BANK OF AMERICA recently donated 5 million dollars to UCSF for the development of its new campus at the site.[…] Notwithstanding all the excitement surrounding biotech, the technology does involve dangers and controversy. Recently, Cornell University scientists discovered an unintended side effect of a genetically modified corn that was originally designed to repel bugs but was also found to indirectly kill monarch butterflies in laboratory studies.[…] This kind of indirect cause and effect is very difficult to predict, and has led many critics to call for a slowdown or outright moratorium on most forms of genetic research. They cite claims that biological agents could potentially be more hazardous than chemical pollutants since biological systems are capable of reproducing and often migrating in some form.[…]",negative,1999,8,31

THIS week's decision to knock back Rio Tinto's $12.5 billion Pilbara expansion to save a tiny, blind scorpion-like creature has resurrected questions about balancing Western Australia's biggest-ever mining boom with environmental concerns in a region of great biodiversity. […] In December last year, the WA Government overruled the EPA's decision against CHEVRON's $15 billion Gorgon gas plant on Barrow Island -- an A-class nature reserve. The EPA rejected the proposal -- to extract, pipe, liquefy and export 10 million tonnes of natural gas per year from the Greater Gorgon and Jansz gas fields using facilities offshore and on Barrow Island -- on a number of grounds, including the impact on the island's rare flatback turtle. The environment minister at the time, Mark McGowan, approved the project with a list of environmental protection conditions. In 2003, the discovery of a rare, small, leafless shrub almost derailed Portman Ltd's Windarling Range iron ore project. The EPA said the project would adversely impact on the Tetratheca paynterae -- a spiny flowering bush that only grows on the cliffs and hills of the Windarling Range. […] Environmentalists also questioned an EPA decision that went the other way -- in favour of a controversial project. In September last year, the EPA recommended Woodside Energy's proposed Pluto gas processing plant should go ahead on the western side of Burrup Island -- a project the National Trust warned would result in the destruction of up to 100 rock engravings dating back thousands of years. And, as the head of the EPA himself has pointed out, the state Government makes the final decision and takes into account social and economical factors. […]",negative,2007,3,31

Exxon Mobil,The Selling of an Energy Policy ,"Under the presidency of George W. Bush, the environmental and energy policies of our government are completely dominated by a group of current and former oil and chemical company executives who are trying to dismantle America's ability to force them to reduce the extremely dangerous levels of pollution in the earth's atmosphere. The first step was to withdraw from the agreement reached in Kyoto to begin limiting worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases. Then the administration cancelled an agreement requiring automobile companies to make the leap to more fuel-efficient vehicles. Other acts of sabotage are taking place behind the scenes. Just as Enron executives were allowed to interview candidates for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -- and to veto those they didn't think would approve of Enron's agenda -- EXXONMobil has been allowed to veto the United States government's selection of who will head the prestigious scientific panel that monitors global warming. Dr. Robert Watson, the highly respected leader of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change, was blackballed in a memo to the White House from the nation's largest oil company. The memo had its effect last Friday, when Dr. Watson lost his bid for re-election after the administration threw its weight behind the ""let's drag our feet"" candidate, Dr. Rajendra Pachauri of New Delhi, who is known for his virulent anti-American statements. Why is this happening? Because the largest polluters know their only hope for escaping restrictions lies in promoting confusion about global warming. Just as Enron needed auditors who wouldn't blow the whistle when the company lied about the magnitude of its future liabilities, the administration needs scientific reviews that won't sound the alarm on the destruction of the earth's climate balance.[…]",negative,2002,4,21

[…] The researchers, a team of 18 scientists from an array of academic, federal, and private research centers, said many options should be explored because some were bound to fail and success, somewhere, was essential.[…] As they now exist, most energy technologies, the scientists said, ""have severe deficiencies."" Solar panels, new nuclear power options, windmills, filters for fossil fuel emissions and other options are either inadequate or require vastly more research and development than is currently planned in the United States or elsewhere, they said. The assessment contrasts with an analysis of climate-friendly energy options made last year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international panel of experts that works under United Nations auspices. That analysis concluded that existing technologies, diligently applied, would solve much of the problem. One author of the new analysis, Dr. Haroon S. Kheshgi, is a chemical engineer for EXXON MOBIL, whose primary focus remains oil, which along with coal generates most of the carbon dioxide accumulating in the air from human activities.Still, Dr. Kheshgi said on Thursday that ""climate change is a serious risk"" requiring a shift away from fossil fuels.

Exxon Mobil,Greens pump up EXXON-Mobil focus,"Green protesters have widened their world-wide boycott campaign against EXXON-Mobil. Although analysts said retail sales showed no sign of suffering, they warned some damage longer term might occur to the oil giant's famous brand, Reuters reports. In New Zealand, Mobil public affairs manager Anna Schulze, said yesterday there had been a few protesters in Auckland, and three protesters outside Mobil's offices in Wellington. EXXON-Mobil has drawn the wrath of an international alliance of green groups, politicians, and celebrities since it backed Washington's decision in April to withdraw from the global treaty on climate change, the Kyoto protocol. The boycott notched up a gear yesterday when non-profit group Pressurepoint said it was co-ordinating an international day of action which involved 100 protests in 17 countries. In London, protesters leafleted staff at EXXON-Mobil's offices and activists said banners were unfurled over buildings and motorway bridges in Britain and Germany.

CHEVRON,Barrow Island turtle issue overblown: study,"The Gorgon gas partners said yesterday new research suggested the number of endangered Pilbara flatback turtles nesting on Barrow Island, the preferred site of an $11 billion gas development, was about half previous estimates.

In 6, the Environmental Protection Authority cited the potential threat to the turtles as a key reason for its opposition to construction of the massive liquefied natural gas venture on the island. Gorgon's spokesman said Dr Pendoley's report had been forwarded to State environmental appeals convenor Garry Middle, who is considering the Gorgon partners' appeal against the EPA's decision.

PEPSICO,"The battle of the blue box  Question the merits of curbside recycling and you risk the combined wrath of environmentalists, politicians, waste managers, packagers and homeowners. Why is the act of placing junk in a box so fraught with emotion?","[…] WHEN John Styth Pemberton, an Atlanta, Georgia, pharmacist, invented Coca-Cola in 1886, it was a fountain soda sold at the counter. Soon, along with countless other brands, the product was sold in bottles. It then became a two-tiered business: Brand owners distributed their heavily marked-up, proprietary flavoured syrups across the United States; smaller independent bottlers blended the syrups with sweetener and carbonated water and trucked the pop to local stores. The bottling business was high-volume, low-margin. To keep their material costs down, bottlers used refillable glass bottles and charged small deposits on them to make sure they were returned. That changed in the 1970s and '80s when the soft-drink industry shifted to steel cans and throwaway plastic bottles. These were convenient for consumers but, more importantly, they allowed soft-drink giants such as Coke and Pepsi to vastly increase their market share. Not having to rely on local bottling plants meant they could flood whole regions of North America with their products though massive one-way warehouse distribution systems. Their increased market clout -- made possible by the new packaging and economies of scale -- allowed them to push competing mom-and-pop local brands out of the market. Today, there are hundreds of soft drinks, iced teas, fizzy juices and isotonic sports drinks, but most are owned by a handful of huge companies. Bottle deposits went the way of the dinosaur. The companies got into trouble when the convenient throwaways became litter at the same time that the modern environmental movement started. Soon, states and provinces introduced ""bottle bill"" legislation to force deposits on soft drink containers. The common ""return for deposit where applicable"" stamp was born. Today, 11 American states and every Canadian province and territory except Ontario and Manitoba require deposits on pop containers. Activists love them because they divert very high volumes of containers from landfill to recycling (often more than 90 per cent). The bottle goes back to the store, and the store sends it for recycling. But soft-drink companies and retailers hate deposit-return schemes since these complicate their otherwise efficient one-way distribution systems. […] Faced with the threat of deposits and an increasingly environmentally sensitive public, the soft-drink industry, its packaging suppliers and the grocers got together and devised a solution. They renamed their throwaway containers ""recyclable"" and formed associations to fund municipal curbside recycling programs. Activists had promoted residential recycling for years, but programs usually failed due to lack of markets for the scrap material. The pop companies had an ingenious idea: They agreed to switch from steel to aluminum cans so that revenue from this high-value metal would offset losses from the other junk. The so-called ""basket of goods"" approach was born in which the declining value of some recycled commodities is balanced out by the rising value of others.[…] So what's the problem? Activist groups such as John Jackson's Citizen's Action Committee on Waste and Gordon Perks' Toronto Environmental Alliance argue that the rate that garbage is recycled has stalled at less than 50 per cent, even in the best-run curbside programs. They'd prefer to see pop containers (and wine and liquor bottles) placed on deposit to get more of them back.[…]",negative,1998,2,7
GENERAL ELECTRIC,Greens 'lost' as growth prevails,"It may be reaching a bit, but when one of the world's leading climate alarmists and activists -British author and journalist George Monbiot -declares that he and his environment movement colleagues ""are lost"" in a world that still believes in what many environmentalists do not believe, namely growth and prosperity, it is almost certain that global warming is in decline as a political issue. In a column this week in The Guardian, Mr. Monbiot laments the failure of green activists to reach beyond a ""set of deep beliefs ... that in some cases remain unexamined."" Mostly, he said, the battle over energy supplies and carbon emissions has plunged the environmental movement into choosing objectives that ""are at odds"" with one another.  Green predictions of collapse have not materialized as the global carbon-based economic expansion continues. ""The problem we face,"" he said, ""is not that we have too little fossil fuel, but too much."" As conventional oil declines, economies will switch to tar sands, shale gas and coal. If coal runs out, other fossil fuels will take its place. Because the greens can't get their political and ideological acts together into a world economic view that makes sense, Mr. Monbiot sees the world heading for ""environmental destruction."" Mr. Monbiot's defeatism in the face of economic and technological reality represents just one aspect of what appears to be a giant shift in the political and economic environment around climate change.

In Canberra, the justification for sacrificing Barrow, a refuge for animals rare or extinct elsewhere, is that the developers, CHEVRON, ExxonMobil and Shell, want to help save the planet. [...]Gorgon was cheered on by WA's politicians even though the state's Environmental Protection Authority emphatically opposed it. WWF and other environment groups pleaded for the processing hub to be moved to the mainland. But the Howard government and then federal Environment Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, endorsed the original proposal.[...]Garrett's limited intervention yesterday was largely to call for better monitoring of the fragile wildlife on the island.But there are doubts that the companies' climate-friendly plan to bury its greenhouse gases under Barrow will be successful. An expert panel found that some leakage of carbon dioxide is possible. And even if the plan meets expectations, it will still only reduce the project's overall emissions by 40 per cent. It's estimated 5.45 million tonnes of carbon pollution will still be released by the Gorgon project each year helping to make WA one of the most carbon intensive states in the world.",negative,2009,8,27

CHEVRON,We've seen the oil spewing ... where's the public outcry?,"[...] Yet almost two months after BP's Macondo well erupted, the oil continues to gush into the Gulf of Mexico and there seems to be little sense of genuine crisis. In spite of its wildly optimistic statements about the ability to stop the leak that has created the worst oil spill in American history, BP continues to make fortunes. [...] Compare this to two far less severe environmental events, where widespread public concern, mixed with a healthy dose of rage, made corporate giants buckle and triggered sweeping changes. The first was the 1969 oil spill off the California coast, near Santa Barbara. A drilling rig operated by Union Oil of California (later Unocal, now part of CHEVRON) botched a well. About 100,000 barrels of oil escaped over 10 days, creating a slick that blackened beaches in the Santa Barbara Channel. The images, broadcast on a relatively new inven-tion - colour TV - greatly upset Americans, as did the pictures in the same year of Ohio's effluent- and chemical-laden Cuyahoga River in flames. They demanded environmental protection legislation and President Richard Nixon respond-ed. In came the National Environmental Policy Act, followed by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Clean Air Act.[...] Given the damage caused by the blowout of the BP well, whose relief wells will not be finished before 8, it's remarkable that the anti-BP and anti-deepwater drilling protests have not been widespread, energetic and angry.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Pollution: The wasteland: how years of secret chemical dumping left a toxic legacy: Explainer: What are PCBs?,"Polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, are stable man-made organic compounds. That was their value to industry and in the past few decades that has been the problem. They were used from the 1920s as cooling and insulating fluids for transformers and capacitors because they did not burn easily, but eventually it was discovered that they also did not easily biodegrade. Although most were banned in 1986, they linger on in detectable levels in animals, fish and humans. When they are incinerated, they can produce dioxins, which are some of the most toxic substances known to science. The biggest manufacturer of PCBs was Monsanto, which marketed them as Aroclor from 1930 to 1977. GENERAL ELECTRIC had a rival product called Pyranol. They were used in an enormous number of products, from lubricants to pesticides, paper, adhesives, plastics, paint and flame retardants. But the concerns began when high levels of PCBs were found in fish, particularly in the great lakes of north America. Work in the 1970s and 1980s established that the man-made chemicals dumped as waste in Lake Michigan were accumulating not just in the fatty sport fish caught there but in the breast milk of nursing mothers who had eaten them.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,A radioactive peril that's 'worse than a meltdown'; More people and land at risk of exposure when spent fuel rods burn," FULL TEXT Even as workers raced to prevent the radioactive cores of the damaged nuclear reactors in Japan from melting down, concerns were growing that nearby pools holding spent fuel rods could pose an even greater danger. The pools, which sit on the top level of the reactor buildings and keep spent fuel submerged in water, had lost their cooling systems, and plant operators have been unable to take emergency steps because of the multiplying crises. By late Tuesday, the water meant to cool spent fuel rods in the No. 4 reactor was boiling, Japan's nuclear watchdog said. If the water evaporates and the rods run dry, they could overheat and catch fire, potentially spreading radioactive materials in dangerous clouds.  Shigekatsu Oomukai, a spokesperson for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, said the substantial capacity of the pool meant that the water in it was unlikely to evaporate soon. But he said workers were having difficulty reaching the pool to cool it. Temperatures appeared to be rising in the spent fuel pools at two other reactors at the plant, No. 5 and No. 6, said Yukio Edano, the chief cabinet secretary. Meanwhile, workers continued to pump seawater into the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors, where cooling systems remained unusable. The pools are a concern at the stricken reactors because at least two of the three have lost their roofs in explosions, exposing the spent fuel pools to the atmosphere. By contrast, reactors have strong containment vessels that stand a better chance of bottling up radiation from a meltdown of the fuel in the reactor core. Nuclear experts said that if spent fuel rods in such a pool were to catch fire, the high heat would loft the radiation in clouds that would spread the radioactivity. ''It's worse than a meltdown,'' said David A. Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists who worked as an instructor on the kinds of GENERAL ELECTRIC reactors used in Japan. ''The reactor is inside thick walls, and the spent fuel of Reactors 1 and 3 is out in the open.'' […]",negative,2011,3,16

A High Court judge yesterday granted permission for Greenpeace to bring a case arguing that it was unlawful for the Government to grant new licences in the wake of BP's Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The environmental group wants a moratorium on all new deepwater licences. Greenpeace will argue that the Government is failing to carry out ""appropriate assessment"" of the risks that new drilling may pose, after the US accident that caused an environmental disaster and killed 11 men in April. It will refer to disaster plans by companies currently drilling in UK deep waters that show an oil spill in the North Sea could be even worse than the Gulf of Mexico disaster. CHEVRON believes that, in a worst-case scenario, a North Sea well could release 77,000 barrels a day - 25pc more than gushed into US waters this year. The US oil giant has also admitted in its official documents that oil from a spill near the Shetland Islands could theoretically reach Greenland and the Norfolk coast line.

WAL MART STORES,A winning pitch for changing times," It is brave enough to open a retail store in this frigid economic climate - doubly so if you are Wal-Mart opening its new Supercentre store in urban Vancouver.

Big, in his view, is not just better - it's greener. (He does concede that there is a ""general suspicion of big."") That argument makes sense, to a certain point, although it is hard to believe that it will sway any hard-core opponents. Much more likely is that it gives consumers who do a modest amount of shopping at Wal-Mart the moral green light to spend even more there, says John Williams of retail consultancy J.C. Williams Group. ""They convince you that you're doing the right thing."" But if you want to know why anti-Wal-Mart feelings may have eased in Vancouver, and elsewhere, look no further than the logo appended to the new Vancouver store: ""Save money. Live better."" It's amazing how a downward-spiralling economy can make saving money - and creating a few hundred jobs - a winning pitch. Numbers-wise, those new jobs won't do much to offset surging layoffs in British Columbia. But the launch of a new store in Vancouver does provide a counterweight to the mass of bad news sweeping the province: stalled or abandoned condominium projects, intensifying forestry layoffs and a withering construction sector. In that environment, the lure of saving money is likely to dissolve any snob factor that kept consumers out of Wal-Mart. ""This is the right store for the times,"" Mr. Williams says.

COCA COLA,Corporate aid or plain hypocrisy?,"CHARITIES and other non-governmental organisations have been significant forces behind the rapid growth over the past decade in the corporate social responsibility movement, encouraging companies to heed the social and environmental impact of their operations, Alexandra Frean writes. But now many of these very same organisations may be wishing they had not been so eager to lend their names and reputations to a cause that has become increasingly tarnished and that is so often the excuse for rank corporate hypocrisy. In the past week, two leading development charities have published reports illustrating, on the one hand, how easily the corporate social responsibility movement has been hijacked by companies more keen on maintaining a carefully manufactured public image than on making the world a better place, and on the other, how far it has to go if its -ostensibly sensible -aims are ever to be embedded in the collective corporate and consumer consciousness.  In Behind the Mask, Christian Aid puts forward a convincing case for international laws to control multinational companies' operations in developing countries, arguing that voluntary social and environmental initiatives, parading under the banner of corporate social responsibility, have proved wholly inadequate. The report uses case studies involving British American Tobacco, COCA-COLA and Shell to demonstrate its belief that the rhetoric of responsibility can mask corporate activity that makes things worse for for communities where they work. The report alleges that in Nigeria, Shell fails promptly to clean up oil spills that ruin villages, despite claims that it strives to be a ""good neighbour"". […] And while COCA-COLA emphasises ""using natural resources responsibly"", the report alleges that a wholly owned subsidiary in India has been accused of depleting village wells in an area where water is scarce, and has been told by an Indian court to stop drawing ground water.[…]",negative,2004,2,2
COCA COLA,Waste talk deadline nears ,"A WORLD-first market-based scheme to trade rights to generate waste appears to be the last hope for peace between Australia's governments and the packaging industry, which are struggling over the crisis-ridden kerbside recycling system. Federal and State environment ministers have slammed the industry, including giants COCA-COLA Amatil, Visy and Southcorp, for stalling talks on improving kerbside recycling and reducing packaging waste.They have threatened to impose mandatory recycling targets unless a new system can be agreed to by Friday. […] Mandatory recycling targets were proposed by governments last year in an effort to meet an Australia-wide commitment to reduce waste to landfill 50 per cent by 2000. Industry promised to meet the commitment through a voluntary system, but has since baulked at setting any obligations on itself. […] NSW Environment Minister Pam Allen said industry's likely failure to agree on a voluntary system brought into play current NSW laws that included sanctions such as product bans if mandatory waste reduction plans failed.

They also feel aggrieved that they often have to bear the negative environmental consequences of more than four decades of oil operations in the region. When communities in the volatile region were not in conflict with oil multinationals over land rights or compensation for environmental damage, they were in dispute with government over more access to oil wealth, or locked in conflict with one another over claims to ownership of areas where oil facilities and accompanying benefits are sited. […] The Ogoni people had been aggrieved since a campaign against alleged pollution and environmental degradation that they began in the early 1990s led to the execution in 1995 of nine of their leaders, on the orders of late military ruler, General Sani Abacha.

CHEVRON,PYGMY COMES TO UK TO OPPOSE OIL PIPE THAT WILL RIP THROUGH HIS FOREST,"DAVID AND Goliath had nothing on this. For today a pygmy from the West African tropical rainforest arrives in London to take on the colossus of the World Bank. Jacques Ngoun, a member of the Bakolo pygmy tribe of Cameroon, is making a last-minute attempt to stop the bank financing an oil pipeline that will go through his forest. Environmentalists and development experts say the proposed Chad-Cameroon pipeline threatens to bring about an environmental and human rights disaster. The governing body of the bank meets on Tuesday to decide on the scheme, which is being heavily promoted by Exxon, CHEVRON and the Malaysian state- owned oil company, Petronas. Mr Ngoun and his supporters - who include the Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu - are hoping that Clare Short, the International Development Secretary, will ensure that Britain's vote is cast against the project, but she has yet to make up her mind.[…] The underground pipeline would pass through the undisturbed and ecologically fragile rainforest where Mr Ngoun lives.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,"U.S. Nuclear Plants Have Same Risks, and Backups, as Japan Counterparts","With the Japanese authorities working to avert a catastrophic meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and one other Japanese plant showing problems, the safety of America's nuclear plants -- and the wisdom of any expansion -- is beginning to come under a new round of scrutiny. Although exactly what happened at Japan's nuclear power plants is still being sorted out, most of the nuclear plants in the United States share some or all of the risk factors that played a role at Fukushima Daiichi: locations on tsunami-prone coastlines or near earthquake faults, aging plants and backup electrical systems that rely on diesel generators and batteries that could fail in extreme circumstances. David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer and the director of the Nuclear Safety Project of the Union of Concerned Scientists, suggested Sunday that while emergency preparedness and safety redundancies were built into the DNA of every nuclear plant in the United States, the string of events that damaged the Fukushima plant was beyond the sort of situations imagined by nuclear regulators and plant designers. ''The real situation they found themselves in is not really planned for,'' Mr. Lochbaum said. ''Those plants are designed to be highly resistant to damage by earthquakes, and as immune as possible to tsunami. The problem was the one-two punch. We design against these sorts of things in isolation, and the combination is a little beyond what they would have anticipated.'' On Sunday, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, sent a letter to President Obama calling for a moratorium on new nuclear plants until more coherent federal procedures for nuclear emergencies were ironed out. ''In stark contrast to the scenarios contemplated for oil spills and hurricanes, there is no specificity for emergency coordination and command in place for a response to a nuclear disaster,'' Mr. Markey said in a statement. Nuclear power provides about 20 percent of the nation's electricity, and there are 104 reactors licensed to operate in 31 states, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A majority are so-called pressurized water reactors, different from the GENERAL ELECTRIC boiling water reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. There are 35 G.E. boiling water reactors in the United States, with 31 of them early ''Mark 1'' or ''Mark 2'' designs, the type used at Fukushima. […]",negative,2011,3,14

Quietly sceptical about the scientists' most apocalyptic claims? Then you've been duped, say environmentalists and political campaigners. Keeping you in doubt has become an international, multimillion-dollar industry, they claim - and now that industry is focusing its efforts on the UK. The 'denial lobby' may have already notched up some victories here. Tony Blair has called climate change the greatest threat to civilisation, but his government's much-trumpeted efforts to curb Britain's greenhouse gas emissions have virtually collapsed. Under industry pressure, Blair recently raised the limit on how much carbon dioxide companies can emit over the next three years. […]The affair is faintly reminiscent of what happened when US President George Bush pulled America, the world's biggest polluter, out of the Kyoto protocol on climate change. That decision was encouraged by lobbying and PR campaigns financed by the polluting industries, which made large donations to Senators and Congressmen and sponsored neoliberal think tanks and contrarian scientific research. ExxonMobil, the oil major, has been accused by Friends of the Earth and others of giving millions of dollars to a long list of think-tanks and lobbyists opposed to Kyoto. […]",negative,2005,3,6

[…] Landfills vs. Polluted Water.  The biggest factor in the attitude change was a huge public-relations offensive by the two principal American disposable-diaper makers, Proctor & GAMBLE and Kimberly-Clark.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,"To tame nuclear sites, release of radiation could last months; Disaster in Japan","ABSTRACT The emergency flooding of two stricken reactors with seawater and the resulting steam releases are a desperate step intended to avoid a full meltdown of the nuclear cores in two reactors.  FULL TEXT As the scale of Japan's nuclear crisis begins to come to light, experts in Japan and the United States say the country is now facing a cascade of accumulating problems that suggest that radioactive releases of steam from the crippled plants could go on for weeks or even months. The emergency flooding of two stricken reactors with seawater and the resulting steam releases are a desperate step intended to avoid a much bigger problem: a full meltdown of the nuclear cores in two reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. On Monday, an explosion blew the roof off the second reactor, not damaging the core, officials said, but presumably leaking more radiation. So far, Japanese officials have said the melting of the nuclear cores in the two plants is assumed to be ''partial,'' and the amount of radioactivity measured outside the plants, though twice the level Japan considers safe, has been relatively modest.  But Pentagon officials reported Sunday that helicopters flying 100 kilometers, or 60 miles, from the plant picked up small amounts of radioactive particulates - still being analyzed, but presumed to include cesium 137 and iodine 121 - suggesting widening environmental contamination. In a country where memories of a nuclear horror of a different sort in the last days of World War II weigh heavily on the national psyche and national politics, the impact of continued venting of long-lasting radioactivity from the plants is hard to overstate. Japanese reactor operators now have little choice but to periodically release radioactive steam as part of an emergency cooling process for the fuel of the stricken reactors that may continue for a year or more even after fission has stopped. The plant's operator must constantly try to flood the reactors with seawater, then release the resulting radioactive steam into the atmosphere, several experts familiar with the design of the Daiichi facility said. That suggests that the tens of thousands of people who have been evacuated may not be able to return to their homes for a considerable period, and that shifts in the wind could blow radioactive materials toward Japanese cities rather than out to sea. […] Another potential concern is that some Japanese reactors (as well as some in France and Germany) run on a mixed fuel known as mox, or mixed oxide, that includes reclaimed plutonium. It is not clear whether the stricken reactors are among those, but if they are, the steam they release could be more toxic. Christopher D. Wilson, a reactor operator and later a manager at Exelon's Oyster Creek plant, near Toms River, New Jersey, said, ''normally you would just re-establish electricity supply, from the on-site diesel generator or a portable one.'' Portable generators have been brought into Fukushima, he said. Fukushima was designed by GENERAL ELECTRIC, as Oyster Creek was around the same time, and the two plants are similar. The problem, he said, was that the hookup is done through electric switching equipment that is in a basement room flooded by the tsunami, he said. ''Even though you have generators on site, you have to get the water out of the basement,'' he said. […]",negative,2011,3,15

Mile-long freight trains running every several days will carry the dried mud to a hazardous-waste landfill in Texas. An estimated 1.3 million pounds of PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, flowed into the upper Hudson from two GENERAL ELECTRIC  factories for three decades before they were banned, in 1977, as a health threat to people and wildlife. In high doses, they have been shown to cause cancer in animals and are listed by federal agencies as a probable human carcinogen. ''Today, the healing of the Hudson begins,'' George Pavlou, the Environmental Protection Agency's acting regional administrator, said under bright skies in a riverbank ceremony here as federal, state and local officials, G.E. representatives and environmental campaigners looked on. […] He said G.E. had acted in good faith for many years and that in 2002, its chairman, Jeffrey R. Immelt, made a public pledge to cooperate and implement the dredging plan, drafted and approved by the E.P.A. Three related accords have since been signed, he said, and the company has met every commitment so far. In organizing the ceremony near the first dredging spot, the agency cast the moment as a milestone in the history of the river and of environmental governance in the United States. Yet environmental officials and groups that spent years fighting GENERAL ELECTRIC 's efforts to challenge the need to remove the mud were more critical. Edward O. Sullivan, who from 1987 to 1995 wrestled with GENERAL ELECTRIC  lawyers and scientists as New York State's deputy commissioner of environmental conservation and ran the state's hazardous-waste cleanup program, said that by pursuing the court challenge to the Superfund law and reserving the right to reject the second phase of the cleanup, GENERAL ELECTRIC  had constructed two potential ''escape hatches.''

CHEVRON,CHEVRON seeks relief from carbon tax," CHEVRON Canada Ltd. is lobbying B.C. cabinet ministers for relief from the carbon tax, an oil company spokesman says, days after the government announced a grant of $7.6-million to compensate greenhouse growers fully for taxes they paid last year on propane and natural gas. ""We are in regular dialogue with the government concerning the competitive disadvantage presented to energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries lke CHEVRON, and a facility like the [Burnaby] refinery,"" Ray Lord, government affairs manager for CHEVRON, said Thursday in an interview. CHEVRON incurs costs associated with the carbon tax while Alberta and Washington do not, he said. ""It is placing us at a fundamentally competitive disadvantage, and that is one subject of ongoing dialogue [with the government],"" he said. Earlier this week, the government announced tax relief for greenhouse growers in recognition of the impact of the carbon tax on their competitive position in the United States and Mexico. CHEVRON paid close attention to the announcement. ""We're in the process of trying to understand it,"" Mr. Lord said. [...]",negative,2012,4,6
PROCTER & GAMBLE,Gulf may get river's waste,"Something strange is happening to fish in north Florida's Fenholloway River:  Some of the females are developing male sex organs. Researchers at the University of West Florida and the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency think pollution from an upstream wood pulp mill is the  culprit. They say that the phenomenon, which has shown up in three fish  species so far, could contaminate the food chain, spreading to other aquatic  species and even affecting people who eat the fish.[…] Consumer products giant PROCTER & GAMBLE built the mill in 1952, putting  Perry on the map. Four years ago, PROCTER & GAMBLE sold the mill to Buckeye Cellulose, which  is run by former PROCTER & GAMBLE executives. The company still is the Perry  mill's biggest customer for pulp, which is used in such products as disposable  diapers, rayon fabric, coffee filters, automobile tires, sausage casings and  pharmaceuticals. Buckeye Cellulose, which owns several other mills, saw its net earnings  double in the 1996 fiscal year. Today, even Buckeye officials agree with environmentalists that building  the mill on the Fenholloway was a mistake, because the river is too small to  handle the plant's waste. The mill chews up pine trees 24 hours a day, discharging 50-million gallons  of effluent into the river. Plant officials say that kind of volume would have less impact on the  environment if it could be diluted. But some critics call the pipeline project  a '40s solution to a '90s pollution problem. Their favorite slogan is  ""dilution is not the solution to pollution.""[…] The pollution isn't just being pumped away, he said, it also is being  reduced. Improvements at the mill will reduce chlorine use by half, reducing  the chance that harmful dioxin compounds will be released. The company has  been working to reduce dioxin for several years. In 1990, state officials  banned fishing in the river because of dioxin contamination. Today, Buckeye  has no detectable dioxin discharge, Simmons said. The fishing ban, however,  still is in effect.[…] For years, private drinking water wells in Perry have produced water that  is brown and smelly. PROCTER & GAMBLE often drilled new wells and handed out  free bottled water. Several years ago, more than 100 residents with bad water filed a federal  class-action suit against the company, but it was dismissed because the  homeowners could not prove enough financial damage. Buckeye and Florida  taxpayers paid to connect affected homeowners to city water. Despite years of testing, the state has never conclusively tied the well  pollution to the paper mill, mostly because the chemicals at issue are so  complex. There are chemicals in the waste and in the wells the state can't  identify. […] When Cummings went to get her free bottled water from PROCTER & GAMBLE  several years ago, she brought along a crew from television's 60 Minutes.  She  carried a tank of contaminated fish to Washington in the back of a pickup  truck and presented them to Environmental Protection Agency Secretary Carol  Browner. She went to Cincinnati, to the home of PROCTER & GAMBLE's president,  and knocked on his door. When his wife answered, Cummings stood there with a  jug of contaminated water. ""Ma'am,"" she said, in a deep Panhandle drawl. ""Your husband is polluting  our water something awful.""[…]",negative,1997,1,12

COCA COLA,COCA-COLA drilling 'will bleed hills dry' Conservationists fear that tapping another spring to increase production of Malvern Water will endanger rare species. Nick Britten reports,"PLANS by the drinks giant COCA-COLA to bore into the Malvern hills to quadruple its supply of mineral water could have a catastrophic effect on plants and wildlife, environmental campaigners said yesterday. The company wants to expand production of its bottled water from 2.6million gallons a year to 11.3million. But an application to tap into a second source of water from the famous springs on the Herefordshire-Worcestershire border has left conservation groups furious. They say the target spring supports a fragile wet woodland environment and that extracting such a large amount of water could deprive rare flora and fauna of much-needed water. Rose Garrard, the vice-chairman of the Malvern Spa Association, which preserves 20 wells in the Malvern hills, said: ""The level of water talked about is massive. We worry whether this amount of exploitation would bleed it dry."" The Malvern hills provide much of the country's best-selling mineral water and Malvern Water is said to be the Queen's favourite. However, COCA-COLA Enterprises, an off-shoot of the main company that is responsible for mineral water, has seen its market share slide from 20 per cent in 1984 to two per cent. It is hoping that a large increase in production will help to re-establish it as a market leader.[…] ""The COCA-COLA plans came completely out of the blue. There really needs to be a thorough consultation."" Peter Holmes, English Nature's leading conservation officer for Worcestershire, said: ""We have concerns over the effect of the hydrology of the area and on wildlife. At the moment there is insufficient information and we will be requiring more.""[…] Along with the planning application, COCA-COLA Enterprises submitted an environmental report to the council carried out by an independent consultancy.

COMCAST 'A',Changing Skyline: The city needs to get creative on bike parking,"Philadelphia's parking shortage is approaching critical proportions. You see people circling the streets of Center City in an anxious quest for an available space. It's unexpectedly hard to park at institutions such as La Salle University and the Art Museum's Perelman Building. But you really know things have reached a dire state when you have to go blocks to find a pole or parking meter that doesn't already have someone's bicycle hitched to it. Yes, this time Philadelphia's parking crisis involves vehicles of the two-wheeled variety.  […] Clearly, it's a tough design problem. A successful rack must provide a parked bike with upright support, and it has to be muscular enough to resist metal-cutters. The rack should also be made so bicyclists can easily thread their U-shaped locks - there seems to be an alphabet theme here - through both the wheel and the frame, to prevent theft.  That tricky locking style is one reason bicyclists long ago rejected the ubiquitous ""comb"" racks. To lock securely, riders must drape the front wheel over the rack, but the maneuver damages gears and cables.  Perhaps one way to ease the parking crunch is to increase off-sidewalk parking by installing cluster racks inside garages and office buildings. Why is it that the COMCAST Tower offers only a single rack on its sprawling plaza, given all its boasts of greenness, public access and transit connections?  Some public institutions provide no bike racks at all, according to the coalition's report.

An activist group, worried that water is being transformed into a profit-driven commodity, is putting Philadelphia's water up against major bottled brands - some of which are merely filtered tap water - in a blind taste test.[…] The activist campaign was scheduled for this week to coincide with the 2006 World Water Forum, a government/industry meeting taking place in Mexico City to figure out ways to improve access to safe water worldwide, Favre said. Today's Corporate Accountability event builds on growing criticism of the industry by environmentalists critical of the use of fossil-fuel resources to package and transport water in bottles rather than relying on gravity-flow through pipes.[…] It is particularly irksome to Favre that PEPSICO Inc.'s Aquafina and Coca-Cola Co.'s Dasani, the two largest U.S. brands, are filtered tap water sold at huge mark-ups. Joan Przybylowicz, spokeswoman for the Philadelphia Water Department, whose water is filtered by Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co. to make Dasani, said a gallon of the city's tap water costs about one-half cent.

Although President Clinton signed the Kyoto Treaty, committing the United States by far the biggest carbon dioxide polluter in the world to reduce emissions by 7 per cent, Congress has simply refused to ratify the agreement or cut US carbon dioxide output by a single tonne. This failure can be traced to US experts who claimed that signing the Kyoto treaty would cost every American $ 2,000 a year in higher fuel bills, a line that was promoted with particular vigour by the Global Climate Coalition, an alliance of car manufacturers and oil companies, including Peabody Coal, the powerful Western Fuels Association and EXXON. The coalition's aim as revealed in internal documents has been to turn global warming from a 'fact' into a 'theory' in the minds of the American public.[…] THE CURRENT IMPASSE over Kyoto can be attributed to a number of factors, including 'the political influence of the fossil fuel industry and its friends in Congress, coupled with the inability of the Clinton Administration and its own personal entwinement in the corporations themselves', as Hertsgaard put it.  The world's bid to reduce its headlong flight towards climate disruption, rising seas and drowned coastlines has been thwarted primarily by this depressing combination of effects.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,ENVIRONMENT; WILLAMETTE FALLS; ACCESS ALL AREAS.,"Debra Flickinger reports on PGE's efforts to improve fish passage in the relicensing application for its T.W. Sullivan plant. Portland GENERAL ELECTRIC's (PGE) longest-running generation facility, one of the three oldest hydroelectric plants in the US, is headed for another 30 years of operation. On 2 February 2004, Portland, Oregon-based PGE submitted an agreement to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), that will be a key step in renewing its license for the 16MW T.W. Sullivan plant. Under the agreement, signed by a variety of governmental, environmental and tribal organisations, the Willamette Falls power house will operate with enhanced production capacity and environmental protections. It provides for several improvements to assist the downstream passage of juvenile fish. In addition, PGE will assume maintenance and any necessary improvements to the facility's fish ladder to help adult salmon and steelhead move upstream. Improvements to the downstream facilities include moving fish through a tunnel currently used to take water around the plant. A gated opening, or 'flow structure' will also be created at the top of the falls to better direct fish downstream. The goal is to achieve a safe passage rate of 98% or better. […] History In 1883, the dam at Willamette Falls was constructed to exploit the hydro power potential of the site. The 899.2m-long dam uses the hydraulic head of the falls, a natural horseshoe-shaped cascade approximately 12.2m in height. The dam runs along the top of the falls between two power houses, varying in height from 1.8-6.1m. The dam maintains a consistent water level (but does not provide water storage) to which the hydroelectric projects, several mills and the US Army Corps of Engineers navigation locks are built.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,A Tale of Two Shorelines ,"AT the Larchmont Yacht Club one day not long ago, near the wide veranda of an elaborate Victorian clubhouse overlooking Long Island Sound, well-dressed parents and well-mannered children chatted on the deck of a sparkling pool. In the seawater below, boats rocked gently on the tide as further out in the haze, in a scene that might have been a backdrop in an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, a flotilla of sailboats raced in distant circles. It was not quite as Gatsby-esque on an overcast Saturday at the minuscule Hudson River beach at the Philipse Manor Beach Club in Sleepy Hollow, just behind the Metro-North railroad station. There, a man wearing scruffy black water shoes climbed into a shiny white kayak and pushed off the muddy bank, while a pregnant woman played with her cranky 4-year-old in the coarse, sticky sand just north of the Tappan Zee bridge. Lifeguards watched languidly as a smattering of members ate at picnic tables, read or docked a small powerboat.  […] In the late 1960's, ""the Hudson River was a virtual biological desert,"" agreed Cesare Manfredi, a retired engineer for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Several decades ago, he said, there was a continuous oil sheen on the water, and a factory near Peekskilldumped molasses waste into the river that was so thick ""you couldn't get a boat into the water."" During the 1900's, Hudson pollutants included waste from the General Motors plant in Sleepy Hollow, the Anaconda Wire and Cable Company in Hastings, Standard Brands in Peekskill and GENERAL ELECTRIC in Fort Edward. Between 1947 and 1977, the GENERAL ELECTRIC plant leaked 1.3 million pounds of toxic PCBs into the river, and was ordered by the Environmental Protection Agency to clean up 40 remaining hot spots by the end of 2012, according to Manna Jo Greene of the Hudson River Sloop in Poughkeepsie, a group working to improve water quality.  In the 1960's, several rivers flowing into the Sound ""were literally open sewers,"" said Mr. Manfredi. The four Sound-side sewage treatment plants in Westchester County dumped barely treated sewage into the water. The water has improved, he added, although Mamaroneck still has sewage spills.  Until the blackout on Aug. 14, only seven beaches, all on the sound, had been closed this summer, including Harbor Island, Shore Acres, Beachpoint, Mamaroneck Beach and Cabana, Orienta, Echo Bay and Hudson Park, according to the Westchester County Department of Health. After the blackout, the county closed all 56 county beaches as a precaution, including all those on the Long Island Sound, the Hudson River, and on inland lakes, according to Gabe Sganga, beach program director for the Bureau of Public Health.

INTERNATIONAL BUS.MCHS.,FOCUS: HOW GREEN IS OUR SILICON VALLEY?,"[…] That sort of problem is typical. The computer industry is not and never has been very green. In its early days, computers were enormous things which occupied entire rooms or even floors, needing their own special power supplies. The early valves and other components were potential hazards. In those days, nobody had thought about landfills or the greenhouse effect.[…]  In 1982, the Intel processor in the first IBM PC ran at a stunning 4.77 megahertz, or millions of cycles per second. These days, you can buy them at 800 MHz, and the processors alone suck up more than 50 watts. So making power savings at the office should include more than just turning out the lights: there's a very important reason too to turn off computers, or at least put them into a ""sleep"" mode.[…]  Yet the demand for power is still there. An office block with 1,000 people generates about 6,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year, the equivalent of driving 1,300 petrol cars around the world. In other words, environmental problems such as global warming and the destruction of the countryside are not just down to manufacturing industries. The computer used to be one of the most prolific users of CFCs, the chemicals which damage the ozone layer. They were used to wash circuit boards before and after soldering operations (such as attaching chips). Since the mid -Eighties, they have replaced those systems with non-CFC-based production, and in closed systems to minimise pollution. (The story goes that against regulations, IBM workers used to wash their hands in CFC trays because the chemical was non-toxic and dried almost instantly.)[…]",negative,2000,8,16

The Exxon Valdez Spill Trustee Council reported recently that only two out of 28 injured species have recovered. Numbers of many species, including killer whales, are still declining. And commercial fishermen are still earning less than in 1989. […] Exxon can afford to clean up its act, but it chooses not to. A similar disaster could happen in Scotland at any time. And Exxon is one of the most aggressive lobbyists against efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and slow climate change. In fact, Esso's bosses find it convenient to believe that global warming is not taking place, against the views of the vast majority of scientists. Exxon was behind plans, exposed in 1998, for a $ 6m PR campaign to undermine climate science. Mobil argued recently in the US that dirty air does not necessarily cause significant health damage. The intransigence of Exxon is breathtaking.

CHEVRON,CHEVRON confirms Gorgon delays,"CHEVRON, the leader of the Gorgon LNG joint venture, has formally admitted to customers that it is not likely to meet the 2010 timetable for deliveries. Confirmation of the huge project's inability to meet its previously announced deadline came only 10 days after 25 per cent Gorgon partner Exxon Mobil said a likely delay in the project's final investment decision beyond the end of this year would not affect delivery schedules for 2010. […] It was also learned yesterday that environmental regulatory authorities remain unconvinced that Gorgon's environmental management plan for the LNG plant on Barrow Island satisfies concerns about the effect of dredging on the marine habitat, particularly a nearby nesting area for threatened flatback turtles. Both of these issues could lead to federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell requesting more detailed plans before the project can be approved under the Commonwealth's Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation Act. Barrow Island is a Class A nature reserve but the West Australian Parliament has passed legislation that allows the 10 million tonnes a year capacity LNG plant to be built within a footprint of 300ha but only under the strictest environmental controls.

For generations, Natkime's clan has laid claim to much of the land in the Indonesian province of Papua, where Freeport mines some of the world's largest copper and gold reserves. Now it is time for a payback, he said. A draft document showed Freeport's recent offer: $250,000 to set up a foundation for the clan, plus $100,000 annually, a sizable amount in Indonesia's most remote and poorest province. […] That said, the protests in Papua have shown what can happen when a natural resources company, backed by an unpopular central government and a heavy-handed military, fails to pay careful attention to the local people whose lives have been disturbed, and who feel the riches in the ground are theirs, not the foreigners.

Enesta Jones, a spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency, said it was not possible to say if ''green'' products are safer than traditional cleaners without knowing the specific product chemistry.   The Consumer Product Safety Commission requires the labels of products that are potentially life-threatening to include signal words like ''danger,'' ''poison,'' ''warning'' and ''caution.''  Federal law doesn't require full disclosure of all the chemical ingredients.

VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS,So How Contaminated Is the Old Nuclear Plant? ,"[…] From 1952 to 1966, when operations ceased and the plant was torn down, the Hicksville factory worked mostly with uranium and thorium, churning out nuclear reactor fuel for research and possibly for government manufacture at other sites of plutonium used in nuclear weapons. In the process, it vented gas into the air and discharged wastes laced with industrial solvents and radioactive substances into recharge basins and leaching pools. Now, 50 years later, radiological and chemical contamination of soil and groundwater remains at the former plant -- one of a string of low-profile nuclear weapons sites across the country that came to light in an article published by USA Today in 6. There are disagreements over the threat this contamination poses. The state Department of Environmental Conservation, the government agency most directly involved, says it is confident the risk is low. ""We have studied this thing inside out and continue to do so, and we are not finding contaminants that pose a substantial risk, or pathways of exposure,"" said Mark Lowery, a department spokesman. The department said it was stringently overseeing a voluntary cleanup being carried out by VERIZON, Sylvania's corporate successor, and would see to it that all necessary remediation is done.[…] But the Star Foundation of East Hampton, a group involved with nuclear contamination issues and headed by a former Energy Department official, contends that a problem of unknown but potentially significant dimensions is being glossed over.The foundation says that far greater government effort, including federal involvement, is needed to find out the full extent of the contamination, to gauge the threats to wells supplying drinking water and to assess past and present health risks. […] Leaders of a civic association in Jericho Gardens, a Hicksville neighborhood west of the site, said that they, too, were satisfied with the state and VERIZON efforts.

PFIZER,The hardest working pill on the market; Viagra can do much more than just save your sex life,"[…] Now, there seems to be another good reason to appreciate them -- they may help to save some of the planet's endangered animal species. Evidence is mounting that men who used to rely on concoctions such as tiger penis soup and powdered rhinoceros horn are finding the convenient and fast-acting pills a good alternative. One landmark study, done in 2004 by Australian researchers led by William von Hippel, involved 256 Chinese men, aged 50 to 76 years. All were receiving treatment at a traditional Chinese medicine clinic in Hong Kong. The scientists found these consumers reported selectively switching to Western medicines to treat erectile dysfunction or ED, but not to treat other health ailments, such as gout and arthritis. And, while they acknowledge it is hard to get data on the trade of contraband animal parts, they found the price of the male genitalia of Canadian seals remained low in 2001 and 2002, despite improved markets for pelts and oil from these animals. They conclude that ""this depressed trade in seal penises, in combination with our survey of traditional Chinese medicine consumers, indicates that Viagra [which was introduced in 1998] and other new erectile dysfunction drugs may be having a conservation benefit, at least with regard to certain animal species."" Critics, including Craig Hoover of the World Wildlife Fund, have challenged von Hippel's interpretation of the data, noting other factors -- such as ice conditions and the ending of Canadian government subsidies on seal meat -- may have affected the seal harvest, which is primarily about pelts and not penises anyway. Still, if even some habitual users of endangered species' organs switch to a pill, it's a step in the right direction.[…] Many thoughtful analysts feel Asian men who have been steeped in this tradition will not be interested in taking a pill that, according to its manufacturer PFIZER Inc., ""enhances the effect of nitric oxide by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5, which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum."" In fact, there may be even some movement from Viagra to herbal measures. A Calgary-based talk radio station has been running ads for a herbal preparation for erectile dysfunction.

CHEVRON,"Push behind IGCC technology strengthens, with 2,900 MW of projects under study","The combination of high natural gas prices and mounting concerns over coal emissions is putting integrated gasification combined-cycle power generating units on the map, all the more so as General Electric is getting behind the technology. Currently, there are only four coal-fueled IGCC facilities operating around the world, with just over 1,000 MW of capacity in aggregate, that were brought on stream between 1994 and 1997. Now, following the two-year run-up in natural gas prices in North America, at least five new IGCC facilities with a projected total capacity of roughly 2,900 MW are under study. In recent months, IGCC advocates in academia have surfaced, arguing on behalf of the technologies' relative environmental cleanliness. Financial analysts have run the numbers and argued that as long as natural gas prices remain above $4.50 to $5.00 mmBtu, the economics of IGCC look favorable. Companies have, as well, been tapping the willingness of the U.S. government's Dept. of Energy to provide seed money for clean coal projects.

[…] During the past few months, a group including Pearson's Cape York Land Council, the Alcan aluminium company, Korean proponents of a space base, pastoralists and a clutch of environmental groups have settled on an agreement for the development of Queensland's northern peninsula. The agreement is intended to build on the widely publicised Cape York Heads of Agreement which was pushed as a model for negotiated settlement of native title rights between pastoralists and local Aborigines.  […]Peak environmental groups were dealt into the agreement with the promise that the entire Cape region would be assessed for World Heritage values.[…] Key aspects of the latest agreement include brokering support for the return of some Aboriginal land, upgrading pastoral leaseholder tenure, finding an acceptable site for the much-touted Cape York space base and facilitating the CHEVRON gas pipeline from Papua New Guinea.[…]Management of the diverse interests in the harsh Cape country always has been difficult.

[…] Clean burn. But the main impetus behind the surging demand for ethanol this year has been its role as a replacement for MTBE, a clean-burning, high-octane gasoline additive now believed to be a carcinogen. State after state has banned the additive. Ethanol is the only feasible substitute, and many states are mandating at least 10% ethanol content (""E10"" at the pump) in gasoline. […] Demand for ethanol now exceeds supply, but dozens of plants are under construction, and supply could catch up by the end of 2008. For now, the established companies are solidly profitable. […] If it's a pure ethanol producer you seek, consider Aventine Renewable Energy. Since going public in 6 at $43, Aventine's shares have slumped to $24, making them far more attractive.

As the number of people on the planet reaches 7 billion, his modernday peers are cautiously confident that the English clergyman will remain synonymous with unwarranted doom and gloom. With the global population headed for the 9 billion mark by 2050, economists are pinning their faith on continued technological innovation and the invisible hand of market prices to lead to a more efficient, sustainable use of finite natural resources instead of a deadly fight to the end for the last barrel of oil and drop of water. Still, the rapid economic reemergence of China and India, both with populations of well over 1 billion, is changing the equation.

And yes, we've tried the pretend over-the-counter ""dry-cleaning"" kits and, well, now we're back at the cleaners.  The problem is perchlorethylene, a chemical that has been used in dry cleaning since the 1930s, and is considered a toxic carcinogen that can harm people, water supplies and the atmosphere. Recent studies have drawn awareness to the effects of PERC-laden clothes in the car (even of its seeping into groceries, yuck) and the home. It seems to have no redeeming qualities, in fact.  ""Almost everyone uses dry cleaners, but not everyone knows what it is,"" says Tim Yoo of Toronto's Eco Cleaners, who recently turned to a new technology because of concern about the effects of PERC on consumers and dry-cleaning workers.  GreenEarth Cleaning, formed in a 1999 partnership between PROCTOR & GAMBLE and General Electric, uses a silicone-based solvent they describe as ""liquid sand."" Tiny droplets of the solvent seep into the clothes and attach themselves to dirt and oil, which they take with them when they're extracted.  The company says it's non-toxic, non-carcinogenic, non-allergenic and completely biodegradable.

Tim Maxwell, the Toronto-based president of GreenEarth, which is headquartered in Kansas, says the company has sold 11 machines across Canada and 1,000 machines worldwide. It's a drop in the bucket: In North America alone, there are 35,000 dry-cleaning machines. […]  Friends of the Earth CEO Beatrice Olivastri is cautious about embracing GreenEarth too quickly.

CHEVRON,THREE ISSUES LEAD TO BRAWL IN QLD GENERATION INDUSTRY,"Three issues lead to brawl in Qld generation industry John McCarthy. THE Queensland energy industry has turned against itself with internal fighting over tax regimes, access to resources and the rights to develop infrastructure. In one development, the Australian Cogeneration Association yesterday called for a moratorium on the approval and development of coal-fired power stations until ""an appropriate greenhouse and energy market policy is put in place"". In a submission to the Government, the ACA called for a rejection of an application for an electricity generation authority from the Millmerran power station developer, Intergen, which is within a month of reaching financial close on a 850MW coal-fired power station. It is understood that CHEVRON has delivered a similar submission to the Government on the grounds that the development of Millmerran will damage the viability of the PNG to Gladstone pipeline. […] Australian Cogeneration Association state chairman Charles Brown said Millmerran and several other coal-fired projects including Kogan Creek, Tarong and Wandoan would jeopardise the viability of proposed gas infrastructure developments in Queensland including the Papua New Guinea to Gladstone gas pipeline and coal seam methane developments, one of which Mr Brown is involved in. […] ACA claims the Millmerren project will emit more than 6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year and, combined with the Callide C power station, will mean Queensland will have an extra 12 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.

[...] Instead, Mr Segal wanted targets for light-vehicle emissions, cash incentives for consumers to buy cleaner cars and ""green vehicle"" grants to help local manufacturers cut emissions. [...] But progress towards increased use of bio-fuels would be limited without a full government-led debate through an ener-gy white paper that would include discussion on energy security, climate change and the need for alternative fuels, Mr Segal said.[...]With opportunities to expand in its core refining and market business limited by competition issues, Caltex Australia, half-owned by US oil major CHEVRON, has been seeking new growth areas.

[…]Citigroup estimates that as many as 3.6 million new jobs might be created by 2020 thanks to the energy boom. The current trade deficit might fall by 60 percent by the end of the decade from today's level, according to the bank's estimates, and the dollar could appreciate by as much as 5.4 percent as imports shrink. ''In a world of high energy prices, the potential economic activity generated by this wave of new hydrocarbon production is extraordinary and should strongly boost national output, increase incomes, create wealth, stimulate consumption and create jobs,'' according to Citigroup. […] Opposition from environmental groups and concerns about climate change -- which is caused by increased carbon emissions from fossil fuels -- could lead to tighter regulation of petroleum products or derail infrastructure projects like pipelines. […] Some experts are more bullish. Mr. Morse of Citigroup forecast that North American oil production could reach an astounding 27 million barrels a day by 2020, almost twice the rate of production of 15 million barrels a day at the end of 2011. Production from the United States could grow to 15.6 million barrels a day by 2020, up from nine million barrels a day in 2011.

INTERNATIONAL BUS.MCHS.,Rio+20 earth summit should look to reduce black carbon through carbon trading; Delegates at the Rio+20 earth summit must look beyond CO2 to black carbon. Reducing black carbon (soot) is easier than reducing other kinds of greenhouse gas emissions. And a market-based international system to reduce carbon emissions is already in place.,"As delegates in Rio de Janeiro meet today for the 20th anniversary of the 1992 Rio summit on sustainability, there is much to talk about. One of the main items to be discussed at the Rio+20 summit is the status of carbon emissions mitigation, particularly CO2. While initiatives have targeted CO2 emissions with some success, much remains to be done, and countries must now look at other forms of carbon emissions to break the deadlock. One of those emissions is black carbon, commonly known as soot - a recognized public health hazard and contributor to global warming. Fortunately, reducing black carbon is much easier than reducing other kinds of emissions like CO2. And a market-based international system incentivizing reduction of carbon emissions is already in place.[…] The concept of carbon trading emerged from the Kyoto Protocol as a way for countries to trade their greenhouse gas emission rights. With a set number of emission rights, a country that had a hard time reducing its emissions could essentially pay another country to reduce its emissions by the appropriate amount. The argument was that it would be cheaper for a less developed country to reduce emissions than it would be for a developed country, but the goal of emission reduction would still be achieved. […] So a company like General Motors or IBM, seeking to reduce its carbon footprint, might end up buying emission credits in a carbon market, thus monetizing the efforts of some social entrepreneurs who risk their capital in financing carbon reduction projects. If a black carbon reduction project cost the social entrepreneur $10 per carbon ton to pay for engine improvements, he can hope corporate buyers will pay $11 per ton in the carbon markets to allow him to make a $1 profit per ton of carbon that his project was able to reduce.[…]",neutral,2012,6,20

CHEVRON,Study offers grim energy outlook; Former Exxon chief helped efforts to examine 'hard truths',"It started with a simple question by Samuel Bodman, the U.S. energy secretary: What does the future hold for supplies of oil and natural gas? The query was made in October 2005 in a one-page letter sent to Lee Raymond, the former chairman of Exxon Mobil and head of the National Petroleum Council, a U.S. advisory group representing the oil industry. […] Some of the recommendations made by the petroleum council probably far exceed what the administration of President George W. Bush was expecting: for example, calling for a nationwide standard to manage carbon emissions and taking steps to moderate consumption. […] The council report warns of ''accumulating risks'' to energy production, including rising geopolitical barriers, inflation in costs, dwindling numbers of petroleum engineers and growing constraints on carbon dioxide emissions. Although it does not say so explicitly, the subtext of the council's study suggests that high energy prices might be here to stay. […] The list of contributors to the petroleum council's report is a roster of top industry leaders and consultants, including senior executives from Exxon and CHEVRON. But the council also enlisted the help of private research centers, academic institutions, banks, government agencies and environmental groups like Resources for the Future and the Alliance to Save Energy. […] Perhaps the biggest surprise is that Raymond, who was well known for his skepticism about global warming when he was chairman of Exxon Mobil, has given his support to a study that says oil companies and governments need to address carbon emissions and offers some suggestions for how carbon dioxide can be trapped in underground reservoirs.

As for cans, more than 80 percent of them are now being recycled. But only 17 percent of PET bottles--which account for about 17 percent of beverage containers--were recycled industrywide last year. One main reason for the low rates of recycling is the lack of what is known as the curbside collection system (type-by-type collection of used containers) in the 3,200 cities, towns and villages across the country. Another reason is that PET bottles cannot currently be recycled for use by different brands--unlike cans, which can be recycled after use by Coke for use by PEPSI, for example.

If CHEVRON and others can overcome the technical difficulties in extracting oil, it could also significantly lessen US dependence on foreign oil, and reduce political pressure to open up the environmentally sensitive areas of Alaska.

There are no international smokestacks and no cross-continental gas-guzzling vehicles. […] As a result in San Francisco we worked with the United Nations Global Compact and a coalition of local businesses to create the Business Council for Climate Change, or ""BC3"" as it is known (www.bc3sfbay.org). BC3 was based on five principles agreed to by all the 70-plus members. These included taking action in your own business, acting as a community champion, developing legislation, taking collective business council BC3 actions, and providing public information on each company's climate footprint. The first thing we found is that even with large companies like the Gap, CISCO SYSTEMS and Accenture, there was a need to know about government programmes developed to help business with climate issues. For example, many of our businesses do not know there are financial programmes to help with everything from energy efficiency to renewable energy or transportation demand management. There are literally millions of dollars available to help companies to do this, but too often business is unaware.

But energy security now means more than just ensuring ample energy supply. It also means doing so in ways that are environmentally responsible and sustainable. […] We also need to integrate more alternative and renewable sources into the supply mix and continue to develop nuclear power. What it takes. […] Multilateral cooperation also is needed to address climate change. Carbon reduction must be shared equitably by all of the world's major emitting countries, and all governments need to be transparent about the costs, risks and trade-offs associated with climate change policies. The second pathway to overcoming our energy challenges is through the development of new technologies that can help the world expand its energy supply while reducing its environmental footprint. Over the past decade, tremendous advances have been made in deepwater oil production, liquefied natural gas and ultraclean low-sulphur diesel, just to cite a few examples. In Australia, CHEVRON is working with its partners on a massive carbon sequestration project at Gorgon. This technology, which would allow carbon to be captured and stored underground, holds the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of oil, coal and natural gas.

[…] The number generally used in the power industry is 20%, that is, an IGCC plant is 20% more expensive to build than a comparable PC plant. But that is a moving target. In fact, the environmental benefits of IGCC are not as clear as they would appear to be at first. Generally speaking, IGCC technology reduces nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions and uses significantly less water than a PC plant. […] In addition, the cost premium of IGCC compared with a pulverized coal plant works against IGCC's environmental advantages. So much so, says John Thompson, advocacy coordinator for the Clean Air Task Force, that PC plants actually have an advantage from a regulatory standpoint because they can meet targeted emissions levels at a cheaper cost. […] A regulatory hedge. […] The fact of the matter is that ""nobody knows what a [fully commercial] IGCC plant costs to build, because nobody has built one,"" says Richard Rapagnani, manager, IGCC, at GE Energy.

""It is always better to clean up the spill before it gets to shore, where the most environmental damage occurs,"" says OPCSA CEO Pieter Coetzee. […] There is a National Oil Spill Contingency Plan, but different government dEPArtments are responsible for the prevention and combating functions of an oil spill. This is due to the fragmented nature of the different laws governing oil pollution prevention and clean-up in SA. […] OPCSA renders a pollution prevention and clean-up service to CHEVRON SA and PetroSA, a sister company under CEF. This service is rendered on a commercial basis, but is not sufficient to make OPCSA a profitable entity. CEF, as the parent company, has agreed to fund the shortfall of OPCSA to enable it to become self-sustainable. Aside from oil spills, OPCSA also manages the environment liabilities at Ogies in Mpumalanga on behalf of the SFF Association, another CEF subsidiary. This situation arose when the old coal mines, which were once used as storage facilities for crude oil, were emptied. The oil residue remaining in the mines has the potential to pollute the aquifers if it is not managed properly.",neutral,2006,10,13

He said although the risk of leakage was very low, it was difficult to proceed with such a major investment knowing that a potential liability could remain indefinitely.""It is absolutely essential that government take over liability,"" Dr Cook said.[...]Mr Rudd said the carbon storage plan was needed because the Gorgon fields had a high CO2 content.[...]",neutral,2009,8,18
CHEVRON,Business warns on carbon trade tax,"A national carbon emissions trading scheme should not be used to boost State Government coffers through more taxes and should focus on environmental objectives, WA industry and business groups said yesterday. […] The possibility of revenue being boosted by an emissions trading scheme has been raised after State and Territory leaders agreed on Friday to adopt a national system by 2010, regardless of the position of the Federal Government. WA agreed to support the plan after being given concessions that energy intensive export industries would be protected by a transition phase which grants them permits to emit while competing countries are not signatories to similar schemes. But the details of how a national emissions trading scheme would work are still being debated. […] The controversial and cutting-edge process of geosequestration, which separates carbon dioxide and stores it underground, remains crucial to multi-billion-dollar plans for the Gorgon gas project on WA's Barrow Island. Scott Walker, spokesman for project proponent CHEVRON, said yesterday the energy giant was confident the carbon dioxide injection scheme - which was a condition of State Government environmental approval for the proposal granted in December - could be achieved. Mr Walker said the conditions of the State approval were being finalised and the project was yet to get Federal environmental approval. The project has been promised a $60 million grant by the Federal Government's low emission technology fund for geo-sequestration, which will require an investment decision on the proposal by the middle of next year.",neutral,2007,2,12

About five years ago, they began to ask for certifiably eco-friendly alternatives.  That's when the 50-employee Long Island City, Queens, company took a radical turn and launched a subsidiary, American Cleaning Solutions, which now makes Focus, a line certified by environmental groups such as the nonprofit Green Seal. The products, which are biodegradable and made with substances based on corn and other plants, now account for about 20% of the company's sales. We went green because it's the right thing to do, and the industry has changed, says ACS Chief Executive Allen Winik. For a small company like ours, it's extremely expensive, and the playing field is not necessarily even. For Johnson Wax or PROCTER & GAMBLE, greening up their product line costs almost nothing as a percentage of their budget. The company spent about $250,000 to reconfigure and develop the Focus manufacturing line in its 65,000-square-foot plant. The investment is expected to pay off by 2015. Certifications can cost as much as $10,000, though often far less for small companies. […]",neutral,2010,7,12

On Wednesday, Bilirakis introduced a bill that would create a more independent role for the ombudsman office, a watchdog arm of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and dramatically increase its budget. Bilirakis and many area residents credit EPA ombudsman Robert Martin with uncovering shortcomings in the EPA's proposed mound-and-cap cleanup plan for Stauffer, including EPA assumptions about whether a mound might trigger a sinkhole and dump contaminants into the drinking water supply.[…] The office was thrown into turmoil in December when a high-ranking EPA official reassigned Martin's lone investigator and right-hand man, Hugh Kaufman.[…] EPA officials in Washington did not return a call seeking comment on the bill Wednesday afternoon.

CHEVRON,All's well that ends well: Santos to bury carbon dioxide,"Energy. SANTOS has revealed ambitious plans to build a carbon dioxide holding facility in the South Australian outback. The $714 million plan, already discussed with the federal Government and called the Moomba Carbon Storage project, could see 400 million tonnes of carbon dioxide stored deep underground in empty gas and oil wells. Polluters along the eastern seaboard would have access to the storage facilities, piping the carbon dioxide to Moomba. The plan is still very much in its infancy and the federal Government has made no commitment to funding the project. Santos hopes to have a demonstration plant running by 2010 and to prove the concept is viable by ''sequestering'' or burying one million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, the equivalent of taking 250,000 cars off the road. Santos was keeping quiet on the finer details of the project yesterday, but the final scheme would require a carbon trading system with a fixed price on the pollutant.

Its campaign claimed the ETS could cause 16 mines to close by 2021, with the loss of up to 9,000 jobs. Citi's environment, social and governance analyst, Elaine Prior, was sceptical: ""We assess potential CPRS impact on ASX companies' coalmines under various CPRS designs - for BHP, Rio Tinto, Wesfarmers, Centennial & Macarthur. Our results don't lead to significant concerns about mine closures.""

The standards use indicators including economic performance (such as total payroll and community donations), environmental performance, labor practices, human rights, social behavior and product responsibility.

PEPSICO,UK firms want incentives to go low carbon,"SOME of the biggest names in British business are ready to revolt against what they claim is a failure of the UK government's low-carbon policies. In a report to be published later this summer, the businesses will call on energy and climate-change secretary Ed Miliband to introduce firm prices for carbon, extra tax breaks and a raft of other incentives, including better capital allowances for green technology investment. The report, tentatively titled Lessons from UK Climate Policy, is being prepared by a loose coalition of businesses and pro-business lobby groups, representing all sectors of industry from manufacturing to finance. It is likely to come as an embarrassment to the British government, which earlier this month published its eagerly awaited low-carbon transition strategy. Ministers said it would pave the way for a new era of investment, creating 400,000 jobs in green industries. Members of the coalition, however, say the strategy falls short. ""The UK's current climate policy has some way to go to incentivise businesses to green their operations,"" said Walter Todd, vice-president of operations for PEPSICO, one of Britain's largest food manufacturers and a member of the group. He believes the government needs to take a carrot-and-stick approach to climate policy. This means providing a stable carbon price, a move that would encourage companies to curb their carbon-dioxide emissions or pay the price. Todd said the model should be the landfill tax, which has rapidly increased the cost of sending waste to landfill.[…] Earlier this year, PEPSICO announced plans to convert oat husks from the manufacture of its Quaker Oats cereal into a low-carbon fuel that would then be used to power one of its plants. This would have cut the annual carbon emissions from Quaker Oats production by 9,000 tonnes. However, Todd said the plans had stalled because the scheme would cost too much.[…]",neutral,2009,7,26

Since plants have also yielded many drugs recognized as effective by Western medicine, it is likely that some of these herbal cures would withstand scientific scrutiny. But the distinction between medicine and magic is often a fine one, and when ""cures"" are based not on the chemical diversity of plants but on the alleged attributes of wild animals, the success of any treatment is surely all in the mind.

Unocal received the patent in February 1994 and determined recently that it could use it to impose royalties on gas sold by other oil companies.

CHEVRON,Gorgon LNG project set to test CHEVRON's mettle - MINING & ENERGY,"ON THE WESTERN FRONT. THE credibility of US oil and gas giant CHEVRON is on the line over its determination to be a major player in the global liquefied natural gas market. To understand the significance of coming events, it should be remembered that the Gorgon LNG project on Barrow Island off the West Australian coast is CHEVRON's No1 future gas project. The past week was not CHEVRON's finest hour for its Australian activities. And the rest of the year holds promise of further challenges that will test its capacity to deliver. For a start, the framework agreement on the Gorgon project ownership structure, signed in 2005 between CHEVRON, ExxonMobil and Shell, is up for review. That agreement, which brought ExxonMobil's giant Jansz gas field into the Gorgon mix, allows for any of the parties to reconsider their position. That's not to say ExxonMobil or Shell will withdraw, but certainly the review process will put the project under a microscope. […] CHEVRON has for several years avoided committing to a FID target date for Gorgon, after saying in 2006 that it was not likely that year. The partners have environmental approval from both the West Australian and federal governments for a two-train, 10 million tonnes annual capacity plant. Last week it was confirmed that CHEVRON had formally requested advice on the level of environmental assessment that would be required to place three production trains on the same site as the two already approved. A third train would lift output to 15 million tonnes a year. The West Australian Government is awaiting advice from the Environmental Protection Agency on how to proceed.

[…] In total, Valero has spent $500-million at Paulsboro to reduce air and water pollution, and meet Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) orders to dramatically reduce the sulphur content in gasoline. It will spend up to another $300-million to meet requirements for low-sulphur diesel. […] Refiners have spent about $35-billion in the past 15 years to meet environmental requirements, but only a small fraction of that boosts output to meet rising demand. As a result, the United States is facing a critical shortfall in refining capacity and that means more pain for an energy-thirsty nation already coping with near-record world oil prices. If trends continue, fatter refinery profits will drive pump prices even higher and the country will depend to an even greater degree on uncertain supplies from foreign sources. […] Lawrence Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, was more blunt. He said the major oil companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp., ConocoPhillips Co. and CHEVRON Corp. are ""disinterested in refining as a business"" […] But again, stricter environmental standards are making it more difficult for oil companies to satisfy motorists' demand.

Speaking at a combined American Chamber of Commerce and EXXON MOBIL lunch in Melbourne yesterday, Dr Flannery said many of the ""solutions"" being proposed to meet the world's energy demand did not stand up to scrutiny.  Carbon trading, the Kyoto protocol, increased energy efficiency and the rapid increase in renewable energy would all unfortunately not stop greatly increased worldwide production of greenhouse gases. That was because fossil fuels would continue to satisfy the vast bulk of world energy demand.[...]  In contrast, he forecast that wind and solar power together would meet only 1 per cent of the world's energy needs by 2020 -- and that assumed continued rapid growth and subsidies for both.

INTERNATIONAL BUS.MCHS.,ECO POWER REVOLUTION IN INDIA CAN BRING YOU BIG PROFITS,"THE debate over energy prices has been heated in recent weeks. A slight reduction in bills has now been promised, but the essential dilemma remains - how can power be both affordable and good for the environment? In India, the problem does not exist. There, green energy is invariably cheaper than coal and gas. The situation presents a massive opportunity for Greenko Group, which specialises in renewable power across the subcontinent. At 148p, the shares offer real growth potential over the next year and beyond.[…] However, there is still an enormous power shortage. The country has to import coal and gas from places such as Australia and South Africa, prices are high and transportation is unwieldy.Renewable energy is different. Locally produced, it is pretty straightforward and reliable once it is up and running. And the power is sold not on the basis that it is green but that it is well priced. Greenko focuses on hydro power and wind, with an element of biomass energy, too. Its hydro plants are located in the north of India, supplied by melting snow from the Himalayas, and in the south of the country, where monsoons are particularly intense.[…] The group sells its energy to a mix of state-owned Indian utilities and the private sector, including an international IT park with big names such as Accenture and IBM. Last week, Greenko unveiled half-year profits up 151 per cent to £8.7 million for the six months to September 30.

[…] Technology will obviously continue to shape the city, but the dangers of ""overspecification,"" that is inflexible topdown design, are highlighted in a recent pamphlet, ""Against the smart city,"" by New York based urban designer Adam Greenfield. The pamphlet examines three cities that were planned in minute detail, with predictably problematic results: New Songdo in South Korea, MasdarCity in the United Arab Emirates, and a settlement in Portugal called PlanIT Valley.[…] Mr. Greenfield does a wonderful job of explaining the manifest shortcomings and dangers of the overdesigned smart city, but his critique ultimately flies off the rapid transit rails because he sees these urban monstrosities as an offshoot of the ""neoliberal agenda,"" a Chomskyan phrase that speaks volumes about anybody who uses it. His suggestion that grand plans of city control are intimately related to the promotion of free trade, privatization, lower taxes and deregulation is not just muddled, it's upside down. This ""neoliberal agenda"" is in fact a response to the economic destruction wreaked by trade barriers, high taxes, and overregulation, not an ideological master plan to conquer the world. Privatization of municipal services isn't a plot to maximize shareholder value at others' expense; it's a response to lousy public provision. Mr. Greenfield conflates this vague neoliberal agenda, which is promoted by unnamed ""ideologues,"" with the alleged dark powers of the companies involved in providing smart-city services, such as IBM, Cisco Systems, Siemens AG, Samsung, Intel, Philips and Hitachi. Corporations are certainly to be feared when they get into bed with government but they have no political power except through government. These companies are ultimately merely responding to demand. The problem is the kind of demand generated by governments. If governments want armaments and surveillance, the private sector will supply it. It will also offer innovation that makes governments more deadly or intrusive, but the fundamental problem lies not with the technology, but its potential abuse by the state. Also, the idea of a city filled with efficiency-checking sensors and carbon footprint monitors is much more closely linked with the neosocialist agenda of sustainability than anything ""neoliberal.""[…]",neutral,2013,10,16

CHEVRON,Oil drills may replace dogsleds with Greenland thaw; High crude prices make it more feasible to go after reserves under the ice,"In Greenland, locals hunt reindeer for food and use dogsleds to traverse the ice sheet. Soon, they may be working on offshore rigs and counting their money. Oil companies have begun looking for crude deposits off the west coast and Joern Skov Nielsen, deputy director of Greenland's Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum, said there may be more oil there than the entire past production of the North Sea. That's about 50 billion barrels, according to figures from Norway and Britain, the region's biggest producers. […] While geologists have known that Greenland had crude reserves since oil was discovered seeping out of rocks along the coast in the 1990s, the ice surrounding much of the world's largest island made getting to it unfeasible. With crude prices up 63 per cent in the past year to about $103 a barrel and the ice melting, the reserves have become potentially more lucrative. Last October, Greenland's government awarded exploration licences to CHEVRON Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Husky Energy Inc. The companies are collecting seismic data to determine the best drilling locations. Given the icy conditions, oil production may cost as much as $46 per barrel, according to Oil and Gas Journal. While exploration is complicated by icebergs as tall as 15-storey buildings, global warming is helping. […] Those reserves would represent a greater challenge because the water freezes into pack ice that can be three metres thick and thaws enough to allow ships through for one month a year at most.

PEPSICO,the saturday essayThe water crunch is primarily our problem,"Food inflation is back in the headlines and as usual the source is water. In 2007 the Australian wheat and rice crop was almost wiped out by drought, coinciding with low rainfall across Canada and Europe. Global wheat prices doubled and Sam's Club in the US began to ration rice. This year Russia is set to lose a quarter of its wheat yield to drought and the floods in Pakistan will cause a $1bn loss of crops.   With the supply of water fixed, populations rising steadily and extreme weather more frequent, the risk of a water crunch is very real.  We simply can't allow this to happen. We are  the world's most important industry, employing a third of the population. And when it comes to water, the food industry is the key player. Agriculture uses 70% of the world's fresh water. According to the International Water Management Institute, it takes 70 times more water to produce the food we eat compared with our other domestic needs, including drinking, cooking, bathing and cleaning.

And, like so many hot new things, it went cold fast. Such was the fabulous stock-market flameout of a company called Rino International, an untested enterprise that, until recently, would have raised nary an eyebrow in the United States. But over the last few years, Rino International and scores of other young Chinese companies slipped into the U.S. stock market through the back door. Rino's American stockholders later lost hundreds of millions of dollars when accusations surfaced that the company had manipulated its books. All told, investors' losses on these Chinese ventures have stretched into the billions.[…] For international investors, Rino, whose name means ''green promise'' in Chinese, was an alluring equation: ''China'' plus ''environment'' equals profit. Like many other Chinese companies, Rino faced obstacles in borrowing money from the state-owned banks. It also confronted hurdles in going public in the Shanghai or Shenzhen markets, where share prices have gyrated wildly.[…] Mr. Little himself was so enamored with Rino that rather than take payment in cash, he asked for shares in Rino.

In October 2007, soon after Rino acquired Jade Mountain, BANK OF AMERICA and about a dozen other investors, including Alder Capital, a hedge fund, bought Rino shares in what is known as a private placement.

But they are also legal and lucrative. For a growing number of banks, however, that does not seem to matter.After years of legal entanglements arising from environmental messes and increased scrutiny of banks that finance the dirtiest industries, several large commercial lenders are taking a stand on industry practices that they regard as risky to their reputations and bottom lines.In the most recent example,  in 7, the U.S. banking giant Wells Fargo noted the ''considerable attention and controversy'' surrounding mountaintop-removal mining and said that its involvement with companies engaged in it was ''limited and declining.'' The bank was a small player in the sector, representing about $78 million in bond and loan financing for such companies from 2008 to last April, according to data compiled by the Rainforest Action Network, an environmental group tracking the issue. But the policy shift by Wells Fargo follows others over the past two years, including actions by Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, BANK OF AMERICA and Citibank to increase scrutiny of lending to companies involved in mountaintop removal or to end the lending altogether.[…] A report published in May by the Sierra Club and the Rainforest Action Network estimated that nine banks were the primary lenders for companies engaged in mountaintop-removal mining in Appalachia, and that they had provided nearly $4 billion in loans and bond underwriting to those companies - chiefly Massey Energy, Patriot Coal, and Alpha Natural Resources - since 2008. The Rainforest Action Network, which has headed a campaign to highlight financial institutions with connections to the mining, said  last month that the policy shifts were chipping away at the financing. Citing Bloomberg data, for example, the group noted that BANK OF AMERICA - listed as recently as 2008 as one of the ''syndication agents'' on a $175 million revolving line of credit to Massey Energy - had eliminated that and all other connections to the company.

R. Glenn Vawter, who has worked as an executive for many of the losers, knows all that only too well. […] But there are plenty of good reasons no one has ever come up with a profitable, environmentally acceptable method for extracting oil from shale. Not only were the previous efforts too expensive and too energy- intensive to compete with conventional oil resources, they also laid waste to the land, produced lots of air pollution and threatened scarce groundwater in one of the driest regions of the country. So it is no surprise that Shell, CHEVRON and Mr. Vawter's EGL Resources, the three companies that won the 160-acre leases, say they are going to go slow with their experiments before they begin considering commercial production of synthetic fuel. […] The companies hope that approach -- known as in situ, or on site -- will be more efficient and produce fewer carbon dioxide emissions than previous efforts, although some of their experts acknowledge that a method still must be developed to capture and store carbon emissions to ensure that shale oil does not become a large producer of greenhouse gases. […] CHEVRON's approach is still a work in progress. One possible method would use injection wells to circulate hot carbon-dioxide-rich gases through the fractured shale formation. For efficiency purposes, the heated gases from initial chemical reactions would be reused repeatedly to help process new shale.

CITIGROUP,Reversing the Flow of Oil,"HOUSTON -- The Singapore-flagged tanker BW Zambesi set sail with little fanfare from the port of Galveston, Tex., on 7 30, loaded with crude oil destined for South Korea. But though it left inauspiciously, the ship's launch was another critical turning point in what has been a half-decade of tectonic change for the American oil industry. The 400,000 barrels the tanker carried represented the first unrestricted export of American oil to a country outside of North America in nearly four decades. The Obama administration insisted there was no change in energy trade policy, perhaps concerned about the reaction from environmentalists and liberal members of Congress with midterm elections coming. But many energy experts viewed the launch as the curtain raiser for the United States' inevitable emergence as a major world oil exporter, an improbable return to a status that helped make the country a great power in the first half of the 20th century. […] Many environmentalists say fracking operations endanger water supplies or create other hazards, including air pollution. Ramping up exports of fossil fuels, critics will surely note, is inconsistent with the Obama administration's push for a global climate deal. […] But the wording of the Commerce Department ruling means oil producers can potentially export much more than just condensates, since the department said it covered all crude oil that is processed through a distillation unit. Basic distillation can occur at the wellhead at minimal cost, and the new interpretation is likely to unleash investment in basic processing of oil in the field to meet the export requirements.

Some remedies depend on body parts of endangered animals, a trade driven deep underground by international p ressure. But tradition is being challenged by modern medicine. Viagra is not even legal yet in many Asian countries, but the new drug against impotence is the hottest thing going. Opinion is divided, however, on whether it will replace traditional cures.  Japanese men are forking out large amounts of money for trips to Hawaii for check-ups and prescriptions.

The impotency drug Viagra, an element of which is made in PFIZER's plant in Ringaskiddy, Co Cork, was the human interest story of 1998 and the talk of every pub in the land. It also did wonders for the State's sales of organic chemicals. Exports of organic chemicals in the first eight months of this year were almost double that of the same period in 1997. Shortly after the successful launch of Viagra, PFIZER applied to Cork County Council for planning permission to extend its facilities. If approved, the extension will allow 100 jobs to be added to the existing workforce of 320. Some 400 people would be employed in the plant's construction, which could take three years.[…] The industry's political agenda is now likely to switch to seeking tax credits for research and development and calling for a State-wide waste disposal programme. Both demands are likely to be political hot potatoes that the Government would prefer to avoid.

Other foreign oil companies in the Kremlin's sights include BP, Exxon and Total, which have all come under fire for their conduct over production sharing agreements. Mr Trutnev said environmental concerns included deforestation, damage to the feeding grounds of the gray whale and the potential for damage to pipelines as a result of landslides, but analysts believe such concerns are a cover for Russia to assert greater control over its natural resources. Russian gas giant Gazprom wants to take an equity stake in Sakhalin-2, which will supply natural gas to export markets in Japan and South Korea. It is having to elbow into projects dominated by foreign oil companies which were granted permits in the early 1990s. The apparent easing of tensions came after Russia opened up a second front in its increasingly hostile confrontation with western investors by warning that substantial volumes of liquefied gas earmarked for export to the US could be redirected to Europe.

Yet there is an investment area where both logic and emotions have recently come rushing to the fore: climate change initiatives. Climate change has, in the past couple of years, received stronger and stronger attention by policy makers and consumers. Green lobbies aim to create an emotional link to carbon reduction and energy self-sufficiency. Governments encourage rebalancing of energy consumption, too - for example, the UK government has launched an online CO2 calculator so people can work out their carbon footprint and develop a personalised action plan to cut their carbon emissions.

INTEL,CLEAN-AIR CONFUSION,"WHEN AMENDMENTS TO THE CLEAN AIR ACT WERE ENACTED IN LATE 1990, COMPANIES braced for the worst.  Riddled with rigid command-and-control provisions, tight timetables, calls for extensive public-review proceedings, and forbidding monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, the 700-page statute had all the ingredients of a regulatory nightmare.  Delays, litigation, political wrangling, uncertainty, and -- more than anything else -- high costs seemed inevitable.[…] THE AVALANCHE OF DOCUmentation from companies -- far more than EPA had intended -- prompted the agency to issue a white paper last 7 that clarified minimum federal requirements under the current regulation for permit applications.  A month later the agency released a supplement to its 1994 revised proposal -- ""a revision of a revision,"" environmental managers note -- that gives states greater flexibility to build on their existing permit programs.  The supplement also provides for advance approval of many operational changes at facilities through use of flexible permits that firms could use without having to modify their current permits.The advance-approval approach has been spearheaded by INTEL Corp., which under the original regulation would have been required to apply for hundreds of permit revisions annually and endure a lengthy review process for each by state agencies and EPA.  ""It was a threatening process for us,"" says Tim Mohin, INTEL's government-affairs manager in Washington.  In the ultra-competitive computer industry, he points out, manufacturing-process changes are routine.  ""We come out with a new product every 18 months at INTEL,"" he says.  ""Time to market is everything.  We can't afford to wait four to five months every time we make a process change."" INTEL worked with EPA and state and local environmental officials to devise the flexible permit system for pilot testing at its chip-manufacturing plant in Aloha, Oreg., which is covered by Title 5.  ""We agree to come up with a hard cap on emissions at the entire plant site, set up enforcement provisions to assure that we don't exceed the cap, and undertake a pollution-prevention program that will reduce emissions over time,"" explains Mohin.

General manager Colin Beckett said the project, to put carbon dioxide underground to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, will be among the largest schemes in the world. The move follows a proposal put by Santos to the Federal Government to use depleted fields in the Cooper Basin for geosequestration. Santos has applied for $275 million in federal funding for the first phase of the project which would cost more than $700 million. CHEVRON said its system would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 120 million tonnes over the project's life by injecting carbon dioxide 2.5km below the island.

BANK OF AMERICA,Carbon trading experts try not to succumb to Copenhagen gloom,"Carbon trading specialists are disappointed with the outcome of the Copenhagen COP 15 summit. World leaders failed to agree on any binding targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, or on mechanisms for doing so. The Copenhagen Accord, ""noted"", rather than adopted by the conference, gives a framework for voluntary emissions reductions by developing countries, but what those reductions are is not even mentioned. Abyd Karmali, managing director and global head of carbon markets at BANK OF AMERICA Merrill Lynch, told Futures and Options Intelligence on December 18 that he was not optimistic: ""What concerns us is that targets outlined are aspirational as opposed to firm."" He said they were ""simply insufficient"" to provide longevity to the market. Karmali was more optimistic about reform of the Clean Development Mechanism - the scheme established by the Kyoto Protocol under which developed country companies can earn credits to pollute more than their normal allowances by sponsoring projects in developing countries that are deemed low carbon. […] Karmali also spoke hopefully about the chances of a decision on REDD plus - a formula for achieving Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, in which developed countries would pay poor states to preserve their forests.""In the best case scenario, [politicians] may get a package adopted,"" he said. He added that there may also be a decision on REDD plus. ""The way the last text was written, REDD plus can become a market mechanism in some countries,"" he said.

CITIGROUP,New doubts surface over Browse site location; ENERGY,"GROWING opposition from joint venture partners, a low oil price and expected delays to Woodside's $30 billion Browse Basin project makes a tie-back to the North West Shelf development a more attractive option than the selected James Price Point site, a new economic analysis says. A report led by a Citi analyst, Mark Greenwood, says the advancement of Browse at the controversial James Price Point on the Kimberley coastline is now ""less than certain"" as a raft of issues including landholder agreements and environmental approval continue to undermine Woodside achieving a final investment decision by 2012. The analysis comes as the actor Michael Caton and the Jabirr Jabirr traditional owner Neil McKenzie stepped up the pressure on the federal government, delivering 12,000 postcards signed by people opposed to the development to the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, in Canberra. The push back from indigenous and environmental groups is tipped to result in delays to an already tight timetable, Mr Greenwood said.  [...] Modelling by Citi shows that the Kimberley option has a superior discounted cash flow [DCF] for Woodside at $US80 a barrel but that the metrics change at $US60 a barrel. ""Under this scenario, the North West Shelf tie-back is the clear winner,"" Citi said. ""Not only is the initial rate of return higher, but the discounted cash flow valuation for the overall project is also higher. Even for Woodside, the DCF of a North West Shelf tie-back would be higher compared with the James Price Point option."" Mr Greenwood said the difference would be more pronounced for Woodside, as opposed to its joint venture partners, because the oil and gas giant would forgo a large chunk of the liquefaction return given it has 46 per cent of Browse but only 16.7 per cent of the North West Shelf. A tie-back to Woodside's $13 billion Pluto project, which has struggled to find enough gas for a second processing train, could also be an option, Citi said, if the main prerogative was timely commercialisation. Mr Greenwood said he believed BHP, Shell and Chevron still preferred the North West Shelf alternative. [...] ""We can therefore see a final investment decision being potentially delayed until mid-2014 if a joint venture partner were to oppose the James Price Point development option,"" Citi said. ""The longer it takes to make a final investment decision on the Browse project, the nearer we are to declining production at the North West Shelf, and this means the more attractive the relative economics of the North West Shelf tie-back option compared to James Price Point.""",neutral,2010,11,25

Exxon Mobil,Editorial: Drilling for NZ oil a risk worth taking,"[...] Undoubtedly, it was unfortunate that Petrobras' five-year prospecting permit was awarded at virtually the same time last year as the impact of BP's massive oil spill became apparent. Equally, it is true that the risk of such episodes has increased as explorers probe deeper and deeper waters in their quest to sate the ongoing global thirst for oil. [...] The rest of the world has now placed the Deepwater Horizon accident in context. Britain, for example, has accelerated deep-sea exploration off the Shetland Islands. This country has too much at stake to step back. Indeed, it needs Petrobras to succeed, given the results of drilling over the past couple of years have not been as encouraging as hoped. Most damagingly, ExxonMobil has withdrawn from the Great South Basin. In many ways, the presence of Petrobras, one of the world's top 10 oil and gas companies, is a much-needed vote of confidence. That is not to say New Zealand should ignore the lessons of the Gulf of Mexico.

CISCO SYSTEMS,GOING GREEN; And what that may mean to telecom,"When ``going green'' sometimes means having large polluters pay for lavish advertisements focused on how much they care about the earth, it helps to look beyond platitudes to tangible specifics. Right now, the telecom industry in general is in the early phase of defining what ``going green'' means, according to analyst Jason Marcheck at Current Analysis.[…] ``Corporations are emphasizing their actions to reduce their carbon footprint,'' Marcheck said. ``By and large, everyone has a `green story.' A lot of it now is a marketing story, which makes sense. But it is unlikely that implementing green corporate practices will result in an ongoing competitive advantage for any company.'' As more companies take the marketing angle, companies will try to ``out-green'' each other, the analyst said. For instance, the term ``energy efficient'' gets stretched to the breaking point and there's a danger of rendering marketing messages less effective if a claim doesn't ring true. Meaningful impact. In contrast, making one's product offerings more environmentally conscious can have a more meaningful impact on a company's competitive position, the analyst said. Three main categories present themselves: reducing power consumption, using renewable materials in products and packaging and conformance with government regulations and/or recommendations from advocacy groups. Equipment vendors have always touted lower energy consumption as a means to lower costs for their customers. Now it's got a green spin. So, metrics and definitions should be clear and, in telecom as in other industries, new certifications may be necessary to bring coherence to the issue of green claims, the analyst said. ``CISCO SYSTEMS recently told me, for instance, that a teleconference with 98 participants has the same carbon footprint as one cross-country flight,'' Marcheck said. ``The message there is: companies are trying to quantify their actions to reduce their carbon footprint.''[…]",neutral,2008,3,17

The ban did not come about overnight, though. Since 2004, the EU has banned animal testing in phases, first banning the testing of finished cosmetic products in the region, but not the sale of such products.  In 2009, it banned both animal testing for cosmetic ingredients and the sale of cosmetic products which contain ingredients that were tested on animals. However, animal testing on ingredients with possible complex human health effects were exempted, such as tests on ingredients with potential toxicity that may lead to cancer. Major cosmetic manufacturers had lobbied for this phase to give them more time to come up with alternatives, according to a New York Times report. […] Clarins is another brand which said it stopped animal testing long before the EU law required it to. Its spokesman said the French company has banned the practice since 1987.  But he added: ""We do not conduct animal testing on our finished products or ingredients unless in exceptional cases, such as when it is required locally by law.""

CHEVRON,Pricey oil making geothermal projects more attractive; Unlocking potential in volcano zones,"Faced with looming energy crises in their developing economies, power-hungry countries like Indonesia and the Philippines are looking deep into the earth for solutions. Both are in the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, an area peppered with volcanoes and home to the world's biggest reservoir of geothermal power. […] That might be changing, though, as soaring oil prices, surging demand and creaking infrastructure in the power sector make it all the more urgent for Indonesia and the Philippines to find ways to exploit their geothermal reserves.But unlocking the potential is proving difficult. Geothermal projects involve drilling wells deep into the earth to tap steam or hot water than can power turbines. Not all of the challenges are terrestrial in nature. This is a capital-intensive process complicated by bureaucracy and other stumbling blocks. The Indonesian Bedugul project, set among volcanoes in Bali, aims to develop up to 175 megawatts of power, or roughly half of what the resort island needs. But the project is on hold because local residents fear it could damage a sacred area and affect water supplies from the nearby lakes. […] The Indonesian energy firms Medco Energi Internasional and Star Energy, are looking at making new investments, while CHEVRON, the world's largest private producer of geothermal energy, plans to double its geothermal business in Indonesia and the Philippines by 2020 despite the heavy capital outlays. […] Brown, the environmentalist from the Earth Policy Institute, said that this followed a global trend in localizing energy policies as oil prices prod countries to find cost-effective alternatives. ''In Indonesia that means geothermal is going to loom large in the energy economy of the future, and that development could come very quickly once the leadership begins to see the potential,'' Brown added.",neutral,2008,6,30

INTERNATIONAL BUS.MCHS.,How to play IT smart by letting hi-tech take a byte out of the bill,"INFORMATION technology lies at the heart of all business processes and both generates efficiencies and consumes power. So it is no surprise to find that organisations looking to ""green up"" and reduce their carbon footprint are increasingly focusing on IT. As they do so, two questions come to the fore. One, how can we reduce the power usage of our IT even as our storage and data needs keep on increasing? Two, how can we use IT to facilitate efficiencies that will drive down costs? The first question tends to lie more in the hands of IT manufacturers than users. The second has a variety of answers, of which smart buildings containing computers carry out tasks such as raising and lowering shutters to regulate internal airflow, sunlight and heating, are but one example.  IBM has made a thorough study of the management of workplace IT systems. The aim was to explore how organisations can reduce their carbon footprint in a sustainable fashion, while at the same time cutting their costs.The study was carried out by IBM's UK and Ireland Technical Consultancy Group, with assistance from the Department for theEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which made its sites available for study by the IBM team. The starting point for the IBM team was the idea that being responsible about the environment has much in common with running a business efficiently. In both instances, the organisation looks to cut back on waste, both in terms of materials and effort, and to be responsible. The IBM study looked at all kinds of kit, including both traditional IT equipment such as mainframes and PCs, and photocopiers, fax machines and even power packs for mobile devices. Many of these devices use more energy than people expect, and use it in unexpected ways - it is not just how long they are switched on for, but also the way in which they are used, the authors of the report found. Establishing just how energy- hungry these devices are, and how this consumption can be reduced without affecting performance is a good starting point. IBM itself reckons that as an organisation, by ""wising up"" to energy waste, it has saved more than dollars 100 million (GBP 57m) in energy costs over the last ten years. Since all such savings go directly to the bottom line, that equates to a substantial increase in profit.[…]",neutral,2008,10,9

CITIGROUP,"BUSH, THE RAINFOREST AND A GAS PIPELINE TO ENRICH HIS FRIENDS","PRESIDENT GEORGE Bush is seeking funds for a controversial project to drive gas pipelines from pristine rainforests in the Peruvian Amazon to the coast. The plan will enrich some of Mr Bush's closest corporate campaign contributors while risking the destruction of rainforest, threatening its indigenous peoples and endangering rare species on the coast.  Among the beneficiaries would be two Texas energy companies with close ties to the White House, Hunt Oil and Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR), a subsidiary of Vice-President Dick Cheney's old company, Haliburton, which is rebuilding Iraq's oil infrastructure.  The pipelines slice through some of the most biologically diverse places on earth. Its remoteness has preserved an extraordinarily rich ecosystem in the coastal Paracas reserve, which is home to such rare species as Humboldt penguins, sea lions and green sea turtles.  The Camisea natural gas project - with reserves of 13,000 billion cubic feet of gas - has already scared off two major investors, CITIGROUP and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. According to an internal report by the US Export Import Bank, obtained by the lobby group Amazon Watch, proposals to mitigate the environmental impact of the project are ""woefully inadequate"" and will lead to mudslides, destroy habitats and spread diseases among indigenous peoples. Friends of the Earth describes one threatened area as ""one of the world's most pristine tropical rainforests"", home to the Nahua, Kirineri, Nanti, Machiguenga and Yine indigenous groups.

If the technology is free, myriad accounting issues arise. Still, without targets and undertakings, and even tax incentives for R&D on renewable energy, it's a big call. Too big a call. Once again, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural & Resource Economics did the Government's modelling on emissions. Bankrolled by renowned environmental and scientific groups Rio Tinto, Exxon, CHEVRON TEXACO and the Minerals Council of Australia, ABARE still found that greenhouse gases would more than double by 2050 -- best case.

COCA COLA,Solid waste management efforts through EPR system,"The reduction and recycling of solid waste has become an ever-worsening global problem in recent years, and Korea is no exception. In response to this reality, the Korean government has been pursuing measures to deal with the country's waste problem since the 1990s. However, there are limitations to how far we can go in alleviating a situation that requires the implementation of measures to enable large-scale waste reduction and recycling in an efficient and environmentally friendly manner. For this reason, the present waste deposit payment system will be eliminated and replaced by the so-called extended producer responsibility (EPR) system in 1 2003. EPR is the extension of producers' responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products to the entire product life cycle - especially for take-back, recycling, and disposal. The EPR system will impose certain responsibilities and obligations on the producers of waste-generating products and packaging, requiring that the producer apply environment-friendly mechanisms to support the reduction, reuse and recycling of solid waste. […] The test project involves the application of the EPR system in seven product categories that must be recycled - glass bottles, cans, paper bags, tires, home appliances, lubricants, and batteries. This group of categories is the same as in the previous system, but will be expanded to also include electronic products (i.e., computers) and plastic packaging. In fact, foreign-invested companies have been playing an active role in leading this recycling revolution in Korea. In May of this year, COCA-COLA Korea Bottling Company, along with other domestic beverage manufacturers, entered into a voluntary agreement for recycling disposed plastic bottles using the EPR system.

The vast expanses of glaciers -- massed, on average, 1.6 miles deep -- contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet. Should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean, they would flood coastal capitals, submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the world's atlases. The infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the ocean's currents, plunging Europe into bitter winter. [... ]The island's ice cover has already begun to disappear. ''Changes in the ocean eat the ice sheet from underneath,'' says Sarah Das, a glaciologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts.

The main takeaway from the ICCR's ""Social Sustainability Resource Guide"" is that companies need to do a better job of both considering and reporting on their social impacts. […] In the spirit of this ""collaborative, multi-party, multi-sector"" approach, the report's authors represent a wide variety of corporations, NGOs, and investment firms. It includes case studies from PEPSICO, Timberland, Merck, Domini Social Investments and others to drill into the details of how various players have tackled the quantification of social issues. And it concludes with a framework to help companies begin to gather around a common model of how to report on the actual impacts of their social programs. But will the report and its framework really help ESG investors get a handle on the social issues most closely tied to companies' core businesses? Take the PEPSICO case study: it's a description of WaterHope, a program established with the help of PEPSICO that provides for the creation of community-owned and operated water stations in poor areas of the Philippines.

The US, for example, will concede a little bit of CO2 reduction if China will do the same.[…] Fighting climate change does de-pend on all countries having confidence that their competitors will follow suit. So, yes, let the upcoming climate negoti-ations spell out shared actions by the US, China, Europe and others.

New Zealand First and the Maori Party have yet to consider their positions, raising uncertainty over whether the Government will be able to pass the legislation, which National environmental spokesman Nick Smith said last night would open the door to unsustainable biofuel imports.

By doing so, the group can revive investment in oil refining, an industry that until two years ago was overlooked because of its poor returns relative to those available from pumping crude oil, said Sheik Ahmad Fahd al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister and the current president of the 11-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. […] A lack of investment in new oil refineries in the United States and Europe has contributed to the two-year rally in oil prices, as rising demand strained gasoline supplies. Oil companies such as CHEVRON Corp. will need greater access to OPEC oil deposits to prevent their reserves from declining as fields mature in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea. […] San Ramon, Calif.-based CHEVRON, the second-largest U.S. oil company, is willing to consider combined investments in oil exploration and refining, said James LeJeune, president of the company's business for the Middle East and North Africa. ""If there is a commercial link between the two, that is the issue,"" he said. Environmental regulations and varying laws on fuel specifications have restricted investment in the oil refining business. No new refineries have been built in the United States in about 30 years. The lack of refining capacity is a concern to OPEC ministers because it's contributing to high crude oil prices, Mr. al-Sabah said. […]",neutral,2005,5,23
CHEVRON,Talks to fire up multibillion-dollar California LNG deals,"WINNING the confidence of jittery Americans was the biggest hurdle to scoring multibillion-dollar gas contracts with California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ian Macfarlane said yesterday. The Industry, Tourism and Resources Minister will meet Mr Schwarzenegger's resources secretary, Mike Chrisman, in California later this week to promote BHP Billiton's liquefied natural gas (LNG) project and several other proposals from companies with lucrative Australian gas assets. These companies include Santos, Woodside and global giants CHEVRONTEXACO and ExxonMobil. The meeting with Mr Chrisman follows Prime Minister John Howard's ""very positive"" talks with Mr Schwarzenegger in Los Angeles last Wednesday to promote BHP Billiton's proposal to ship LNG to a massive floating terminal the company plans to build 23km off the California coast. […] The proposal has stirred up opposition from at least two Californian councils -- Malibu and Oxnard -- and recently 25 US environmental groups sent a letter to Mr Chrisman requesting a meeting. The councils and groups fear the BHP Billiton project, expected to generate $A15 billion in Australian exports if approved, could become an environmental disaster or a terrorist target. Mr Macfarlane said easing US community fears would be the toughest task, although he talked up Australia's long safety record. ""The biggest issue is allaying the safety and environmental concerns local people have,"" he said.

CHEVRON,Majors pass on main lobbying effort to unlock ANWR plain to oil drilling,"Amid Republican predictions that Congress this year will finally authorize oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain, ConocoPhillips Co., one of four major oil companies operating on Alaska's North Slope, confirmed last week that it has withdrawn from a large lobbying campaign for ANWR development. ConocoPhillips' move left only one of the majors, ExxonMobil Corp., as a participant in Arctic Power. Groups opposed to oil drilling in ANWR, who disclosed ConocoPhillips' departure from Arctic Power, hailed the move as evidence that the majors do not share the same enthusiasm for tapping the coastal plain's oil as do many Republican lawmakers. Michael Leone, vice-president of Green Century Capital Management, which manages ""environmentally screened"" mutual funds, said Wednesday that decisions by ConocoPhillips, BP and CHEVRONTEXACO Corp. to quit Arctic Power ""certainly show that [opening ANWR] is not a high priority for them."" […] While ConocoPhillips confirmed last week its decision to quit Arctic Power, the company said it actually left the group in mid-2004. A spokesman for CHEVRONTEXACO said his company dropped out of the lobbying group in 2000, a move that was not publicized at the time. BP pulled out of Arctic Power in 2002, a decision that was widely covered then. […] None of the companies that quit Arctic Power categorically rejected the possibility of drilling on the coastal plain should the opportunity present itself.

CITIGROUP,Let's have some clear thinking on carbon price; G-BIZ,"There's a lot of wild talk that does not help the national debate. THE morbid rhetoric is increasing already, ahead of next year's main game when the new multi-party climate change committee tries to nut out a policy that will put a price on carbon, garner support from the business community and pass through a greens-controlled Senate. One commentator moaned this week the government-appointed business committee on climate change was a ""hanging committee"" designed to ""string up"" the foreign owners of coal-fired power stations in Australia. Such hysteria augurs badly, as the fossil fuel lobby - and outright opponents to a carbon price - are very well represented on the committee, and there is nobody representing the renewables sector. NAB and Woodside Petroleum chairman Michael Chaney recently complained about how ""thin skinned"" politicians were, ""threatening"" business leaders who expressed their views. [...] Cutting through the climate change rhetoric has been Elaine Prior, head environment, social and governance analyst at CITIGROUP. Last week, in the wake of a Greenpeace report on lending to the coal industry in Australia (covered previously here), Prior and her colleagues tried to quantify the exposure of our big four banks if a price on carbon were to wipe out the value of their loans to coal-fired power stations. This is not far-fetched. As Greenpeace this week leafleted a Melbourne presentation by ANZ chief Mike Smith, and scaled the bank's Brisbane office to unfurl a huge ""ANZ: polluting your world"" banner . . . the banks are definitely worried - especially in Victoria's Latrobe Valley, where the first plant shutdowns are expected. Bank shareholders are worried, too. [...] After 20 years in broking and four years since she switched to the green side of the sharemarket, Prior thinks most environmental issues are ""fairly marginal in terms of the valuation impact"". Yes, she says, we've all been reminded of environmental risks by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill but it's easy to say that in hindsight. ""What do you and I do when investing now . . . wipe $30 billion off the value of every oil company?

CHEVRON,Cameroon; WB Group Approves Support for Chad-Cameroon Development,"Washington - The Board of the World Bank Group today overwhelmingly agreed to support the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project - an unprecedented framework to transform oil wealth into direct benefits for the poor, the vulnerable and the environment. In addition to the financing, the package of support includes a first-of-its-kind program to direct new revenues to support economic and social development programs in Chad, which is one of the world's poorest countries. The project, which is expected to cost $3.7 billion, will develop the oil fields at Doba in southern Chad and construct a 1,070 km pipeline to offshore oil-loading facilities on Cameroon's Atlantic coast. The sponsors are ExxonMobil of the U.S. (the operator, with 40 percent of the private equity), Petronas of Malaysia (35 percent), and CHEVRON of the U.S. (25 percent). Depending on world oil prices, the project could yield up to $2 billion in revenues for Chad and $500 million for Cameroon over the 25-year production period. […] Protecting the Environment. Any large project of this nature entails risks for the natural environment. From the start, the environmental risks of this project were seen to be significant but manageable.

CITIGROUP,Capturing Carbon's Potential INTRODUCTION: Will the chemical industry benefit from carbon capture technology?,"CARBON CAPTURE and sequestration (CCS) technology might still be at an experimental and development stage, but several companies, including those in the chemical industry, are lining up to take advantage of its opportunities. [...] Post-combustion capture involves chemical stripping of CO2 using amine solvent scrubbing, membrane separation or cryogenic separation after the combustion of the fossil fuel for the generation of power. It can be retrofitted to conventional power plants but is said to be expensive, according to a CCS report from US-based CITIGROUP Research. [...] The process, according to CITIGROUP, involves the removal of CO2 using the same methods as post-combustion, but the fossil fuel is gasified first by reacting with oxygen or steam prior to power generation. Hydrogen is also produced in this process. [...] Oxyfuel combustion, which is still at a demonstration phase, can be retrofitted to conventional power plants, according to CITIGROUP. The process involves burning fuel in a nearly pure oxygen environment, resulting in a concentrated exhaust gas stream of CO2, which is either absorbed using solvents or adsorbed onto membranes and subsequently captured. [...] US-based Eastman Chemical, which has many years of experience in coal-gas technologies to produce feedstock for its chemical processes, also has a big interest in CCS development aside from reducing CO2 emissions, CITIGROUP reported. ""Eastman has an interest in the use of CO2 in enhanced oil recovery and is carrying out its project development and testing in the US,"" CITIGROUP said. Industrial gases companies such as Linde, Air Liquide, of France, Praxair and Air Products, both US, are also expected to gain. Large quantities of oxygen are required for both the IGCC and oxy-combustion processes, according to CITIGROUP. These companies can also deploy their skills in CO2 purification and transport, as well as provision specialized equipment.

[…] Over the past 10 years, the large integrated oil companies have made capital expenditures roughly equal to their net earnings. In fact, between 1991 and 2005, ExxonMobil's cumulative capital and exploration expenditures (some US$210-billion) actually exceeded the company's earnings. CHEVRON spent US$11-billion last year alone.

PEPSICO,Aquarium drinks up Coke bottle exposure,"Coca-Cola has filled Florida grocery stores with more than 10,000 cases of  special-edition bottles commemorating the opening of the Florida Aquarium. And there's a tale behind Coke's relationship with the aquarium, an example  of how marketers are fiercely competing to seal up promotional ties with  environmentally friendly causes.[…] The aquarium hopes to stage more joint promotions to stretch its  $ 1.3-million advertising budget, giving preference to companies that have made  corporate donations. Coke's support, however, is the result of a business deal  designed to benefit both sides.[…] The 900-space aquarium parking lot sits on 11 acres that once housed a Coke  bottling plant and distribution center. The Florida Coca-Cola Bottling Co. now  rents the land to the aquarium. And Coca-Cola made sure the long-term lease  required that the aquarium serve only Coca-Cola products and sign no  advertising deals with any Coke competitors. In return, Coca-Cola paid $ 1.3-million to clean up hazardous waste buried  on the site. If the aquarium terminates the advertising pact, Coke can get its  $ 1.3-million back.

While the libido-enhancing effects of guarana may have more to do with fiction than fact, it is no small wonder that products from the Amazon, a region that has long gripped popular imagination as the world's largest rain forest, are being viewed as a way for the region to develop without harming the environment at a time when other forces are threatening to speed its depletion.[…] If there is any company that is intent on avoiding the fate of these ventures it is AmBev, the company planning to export a guarana drink with PEPSI.

Ms Prior, an analyst with Citigroup, said a carbon price at $20 a tonne would affect companies like BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto by about 0.4 per cent of profit, rising to 1 per cent at $50 a tonne. ``The smaller, pure-coal companies are more exposed. A carbon cost of $20 a tonne would reduce company net profit by 2 per cent to 4 per cent,'' the report said.

So companies like Google, Yahoo, AMAZON.com and Microsoft have been engaged in a mad dash to find spots in the United States that have plenty of electricity and land. As a result, more data centers have been built in states like Washington, Texas, Iowa and Oklahoma.

Soon you'll be encouraged to look at your bike not just as a means of occasional exercise but as a serious mode of transport. And with only 2% of journeys being made by bike, it's not surprising that both the government and cycling organisations in Britain are keen to get us moving. […]  Pharmaceuticals giant PFIZER has its headquarters in Kent. It is using Bike Week to promote cycling as well as other greener forms of transport. Many of their employees share cars or use public transport. But currently only 250 workers out of 5,000 cycle to work despite the fact that more than 50% of them live within cycling distance. To increase participation PFIZER promises a free breakfast to all those who arrive on a bike during Bike Week and is also promoting a scheme in which employees are paid pounds 2 for each day they cycle to work.  Although most employers wouldn't go that far, there are other ways to accrue a bit of extra cash. Individuals who cycle as part of their employment are able to claim 20 pence a mile. […]  So with increased incentives, awareness and legislation, it is possible that the government could make its 8% target. But, says Lewis, it remains a challenge rather than a certainty.

GOOGLE,Incentives may work where a carbon tax fails; Dennis Posadas suggests an alternative to the politically challenging cap-and-trade laws,"As Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard's experience with a carbon tax shows, often it is never easy to impose a tax on the vast majority of people to solve a common problem. Because of the widespread opposition to the carbon tax designed to help Australia meet its carbon emission targets, the Gillard administration has resorted to giving cash bonuses to families hard hit by the tax, up to A$100 (HK$800) per child and A$250 per pensioner.  But in a dire scenario where many countries decide to say no to a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system to help reduce emissions, and if there is deadlock on a future treaty agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol, what is the way forward? China has decided to pass its own cap-and-trade programme, but will others? One way is to strengthen the nascent voluntary carbon emission markets, where companies and individuals who feel it is their duty to save the environment buy emission credits to offset their own emissions, without regard for whether there is any requirement for them to do so. For example, large companies like Google and GM purchase emissions credits from the carbon markets to offset their emissions to zero. These credits help fund other renewable energy and energy-efficiency projects to displace or lessen the need for fossil fuel. […]",positive,2012,10,31

WAL MART STORES,Retailers to sharpen green focus in 2010," The UK's biggest retailers, Asda and Tesco, have made public plans to reduce their environmental impact in 2010 in moves that have been welcomed by packaging commentators. Last month, Asda announced it would launch its packaging scorecard in 2010, while Tesco revealed plans to cut the carbon footprint of its entire supply chain by 30% by 2020.  Asda's parent company Wal-Mart began using a packaging scorecard in the US in February 2008, after a year-long trial. It was previously expected to be launched in the UK this year, but the retailer has now said this will be in early 2010.

By purchasing the RSPO certificates, direct support is provided to small-scale farmers and sustainable palm oil production. Adherence and certification to RSPO principles and criteria provides rigorous assurance that palm oil is cultivated and processed in a sustainable and responsible manner. The certification of the first groups of independent smallholders is a major step forward for Thailand's palm oil industry. […] Darrel Webber, RSPO secretary-general, commented: ""As the third-largest producer of crude palm oil in the world, more than 70 per cent of oil palm in Thailand is produced by independent smallholders. Without certification, it is now difficult to compete in the world market. Because of the increased demand for environmentally friendly products from consumers, more and more manufacturers who use palm oil as a raw material are looking for certified palm oil. However, there are challenges, and the smallholders need assistance to become certified.

WAL MART STORES,"Catch of the day: Sustainable fish; Firm aims to save seafood, habitat","Ten years ago, Henry and Lisa Lovejoy stood ankle-deep amid dead tuna in a Tokyo warehouse the size of a football field. The tuna were headed to the dinner tables of Japan, and the warehouses would fill with fresh kill the next day. And the next. And the next. Some tuna were so young, they hadn't reproduced. It was then that the couple, who ran a $20 million-a-year lobster export business in Boston, knew they had to stop doing what they were doing. ""We thought, 'This industry has some serious environmental baggage,'"" says Henry, 43. ""We had a strong level of discomfort being part of an industry that wasn't managing its resources well.""  Out of that sentiment came EcoFish, an 8-year-old company considered a pioneer in the market of ""sustainable"" seafood -- a movement increasingly embraced by major seafood producers and retailers, including Wal-Mart. EcoFish sells only seafood that is grown or caught in eco-friendly ways. That means the fish producers don't harm the environment and take no more fish out of the ocean than are born each year. […] It won't be alone. A handful of small eco-friendly seafood companies have sprouted in recent years and retailers are pressuring large producers to get on the sustainable bandwagon. Wal-Mart, the No. 1 retailer, said last year that it would, within five years, purchase wild-caught seafood only from fisheries deemed sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council. The non-profit is considered the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for sustainable fisheries, says Sutton. Some of the products that EcoFish carries come from fisheries certified by the marine council. Sutton attended a meeting with seafood producers at Wal-Mart headquarters earlier this year. The producers were all ""pledging allegiance"" to sustainability, Sutton says. ""These are the same people who told me to get lost before."" Lovejoy says EcoFish, which has grown slowly over nine years, expects to triple sales in the next 18 months. Lovejoy says its trusted brand will help EcoFish survive along with the bigger players, or win it a spot inside one of them. ""We've already opened a lot of eyes,"" says Lovejoy.

That status triggers extra environmental reviews and layers of tough regulation and remediation.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Businesses try to outpace U.S. regulators on emissions,"Ten major companies with operations across the U.S. economy utilities, manufacturing, petroleum, chemicals and financial services have banded together with leading environmental groups to call for a firm nationwide limit on carbon dioxide emissions that would lead to reductions of 10 to 30 percent over the next 15 years. Introduction of this group, which includes industry giants like GENERAL ELECTRIC, DuPont and Alcoa, is aimed at adding to the recent impetus for congressional action on emissions controls and the creation of a market in which allowances to emit carbon dioxide could be traded in a way that achieves the greatest reduction at the lowest cost. The diversity of the coalition some members had already come out for other forms of emissions control, like a carbon tax or voluntary controls, but others had been silent on climate-change issues until now could send a strong signal that businesses want to get ahead of the increasing political momentum for federal emissions controls, in part to ensure that their long-term interests are protected. Many energy producers and manufacturers have expressed concern that various state efforts, if not coordinated, could lead to a scattershot system of regulation. Others worry that harsher measures, like a stiff tax on fossil fuels, the biggest contributor to global-warming gases, could be imposed if they do not reach a consensus on a legislative approach. The group's formal announcement is scheduled for Monday, the day before President George W. Bush is to deliver his State of the Union address and offer the administration's newest basket of proposals to promote energy security and combat global warming. Aside from GENERAL ELECTRIC and Alcoa, Caterpillar is the leading manufacturing company among the group, which also includes four utilities Duke Energy, based in North Carolina; PG&E, of California; FPL Group, of Florida, and PNM Resources, of New Mexico. The group counts the multinational oil company BP and Lehman Brothers as members as well.

Suddenly, as the global warming debate heats up, Congress, some states and even the Bush administration are determined to change that.","Global warming was far from Rick Wagoner's mind in November when he was asked whether his company believed it was real. ``I think our policy statement, as I recall, was crafted about 10 years ago, when Harry Pearce was here,'' General Motors' CEO said in his office high above the Detroit River. ``And the comment was along the lines that there's certainly ample debate on both sides.'' In the decade since Pearce, then vice chairman, urged government, industry and environmentalists to study the issue and seek ways to head off potential problems, scientists have reached near unanimity that human activity - including the burning of gasoline in cars and trucks - contributes to global warming.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,"To use coal property and serve 'clean' power desires, plan would combine IGCC and wind","Hoping to sell ""clean"" electricity to utilities in California and the Southwest, two developers, Anadarko Petroleum and TriLateral Energy, are proposing to build an unregulated 900-MW facility in Wyoming that would combine an integrated gasification combined-cycle unit with two wind farms.  The project, the Wyoming Clean Energy Center, would be in the southwestern part of the state, nearest to California and other Western markets, the companies told the Wyoming Infrastructure Authority. Anadarko and TriLateral plan to market power from the project as a ""Carbon Net Zero Emission Facility"" to make it appealing to Western buyers. The proposal reflects the growing interest in developing clean-coal projects, either for generation or to convert coal to liquid, said Steve Waddington, WIA executive director. […] The companies see several advantages to the project. The wind and owned-coal are solid hedges against fuel price risk. And the baseload coal-fired plant can ""firm"" the intermittent wind. Wyoming Governor David Freudenthal has established a clean-coal task force that will seek federal funding for an IGCC demonstration project. A separate bill would give the WIA, which focuses on transmission infrastructure, authority over supporting clean-coal projects, he said. In another potential boost to Wyoming's efforts to develop an IGCC plant, GENERAL ELECTRIC expects to announce in 7 that it has developed IGCC technology that can burn Western coal at high altitudes, Waddington said.

WAL MART STORES,The social responsibility revolution,"Business educators may be in for a surprise. Something extraordinary is happening in the global marketplace that defies classic principles taught at virtually every business school. Superior product quality and competitive pricing may no longer stand above all others as the most critical variables in the equation for business success. In the evolving global marketplace that I call World Inc., a third strategic factor is coming into play: social responsibility. By that, I mean making products and delivering services that generate profits but also help society address challenges such as climate change, energy security, healthcare, and poverty. […] Take, for example, the culture shift occurring at General Electric. GE's ""Ecomagination"" campaign features a lovable dancing rain-forest elephant that projects a friendly corporate face for CEO Jeffrey Immelt that is very different from the hard-edged, calculating one offered by his legendary predecessor, Jack Welch. […] But it's the actions of Wal-Mart, the world's largest - and perhaps most controversial - overall retailer (serving 176 million customers each week), that signals the true significance of this trend. In February, delivering the keynote lecture at the Prince of Wales's Business and Environment Program in London, Wal-Mart CEO H. Lee Scott unveiled ""Sustainability 360,"" which he described as a company-wide commitment to sustainability going beyond its direct environmental footprint to engage everyone the company touches: associates, suppliers, communities, and customers. Like GE and others competing in World Inc., Wal-Mart is quick to recognize the opportunities that spring from sustainability. By requiring suppliers to reduce product packaging by 5 percent by 2013, it expects to realize savings equal to removing 213,000 trucks from the road and saving approximately 324,000 tons of coal and 67 million gallons of diesel fuel per year. They'll save millions more by making stores 30 percent more efficient by 2012, increasing fleet efficiency by 25 percent by 2010 and reducing solid waste from its US stores and Sam's Clubs by 25 percent by 2008.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Paper Maker Writes It On the Wind ,"WHEN the Nature Conservancy produced its latest annual report, it chose to print it on environmentally sound Mohawk Options paper. GENERAL ELECTRIC made the same choice, in publishing its first comprehensive ''citizenship report.'' By manufacturing a line of paper created entirely from recycled material with equipment powered by wind-generated electricity, Mohawk Paper Mills has stepped up to satisfy those with ecologic concerns, showing what a big corporation can do to support alternative energy sources. ''Paper is a major business decision, there's no two ways about it,'' said Kathleen Jamieson, creative director for the Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit group dedicated to global conservation with headquarters in Arlington, Va. ''You're always seeking to have the quality, the price and the environmentally preferable paper, in this case, come together in the happiest junction.'' Mohawk, headquartered upstate in Cohoes, near Albany, started researching wind power in 8 2003. Its initial purchase was from a farm in Fenner, east of Syracuse. Beginning this month with a second contract for wind electricity, largely generated in Wyoming, the company now buys a total of 45,000 megawatt-hours of wind electricity each year. That is enough to support 21 percent of its total power needs for its two mills in New York, and half of the power to run a recently purchased plant in Hamilton, Ohio, according to figures provided by Marion Trieste, a wind power advocate working with the company.

A big supporter of oil sands industry expansion, as well as export pipelines such as Keystone XL, Mr. Immelt said he wants to share his company's environmental technology as a way to win over critics concerned about the climate impact of the oil sands.  GE, one of the largest multinational corporations with a market capitalization of $264-billion (U.S.), is working with the industry's environmental technology sharing group, known as Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA), on such projects as greenhouse gas and water reduction in steam-driven and mining operations. The company and others need to drop their guards about intellectual property as they try to solve overarching and thorny problems that have served to stoke campaigns against development among environmental groups and many politicians throughout North America, Mr. Immelt said in an interview with The Globe and Mail in Calgary.

MICROSOFT,Climate; Microsoft Buys Carbon Credits From Madagascar Rainforest,"Madagascar's government has agreed to sell forest-related carbon credits to Microsoft and Zurich's zoo, which will help protect the Makira National Park, in the first sale of state-owned REDD+ credits in Africa, according to the group that manages the park.  The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), an international charity headquartered in New York City, said the revenues from selling carbon credits generated by avoided deforestation in Makira will finance the conservation of one of Madagascar's most pristine rainforest ecosystems, while supporting the livelihoods of local people. The funds will be used by the government for activities under its Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation ""plus"" conservation (REDD+) programme, and by WCS to manage Makira park. But the largest share - half of the proceeds - will go to support local communities in areas around Makira for education, health and other projects, WCS said. Tech giant Microsoft said support for forest conservation and community projects like Makira is ""an important part of Microsoft's strategy to reduce its environmental impact, support sustainable economic growth, improve health and education, and address societal challenges"". ""The project's important role in protecting a crucial area of biodiversity value also aligns with Microsoft's own focus on using technology, information and research to develop new approaches and solutions to sustainability,"" Rob Bernard, Microsoft's chief environmental strategist, said in a statement.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,The Dirty War Against Clean Coal,"  WHILE  President Obama's cap-and-trade proposal to reduce greenhouse gases has been the big topic of recent environmental debate, the White House has also been pushing a futuristic federal project to build a power plant that burns coal without any greenhouse gases. Sounds great, right? Except the idea is a rehash of a proposal that went bust the first time around. More important, the technology already exists to make huge reductions in greenhouse emissions from coal, allowing power companies to begin cutting the carbon footprint of coal today. Instead, advanced-technology coal power sits on the shelf while regulators wait to see what happens with a project that may be just an expensive boondoggle. […] The Obama administration's FutureGen plan calls for yet another year of study before any actual action; test runs may not begin for a decade. No wonder the project's nickname is ''NeverGen.'' This is part of a Washington tradition -- beginning pie-in-the-sky projects that create an excuse to avoid forms of conservation and greenhouse-gas reduction that are possible immediately. Companies including GENERAL ELECTRIC  have already perfected technology to reduce emissions substantially, called ''integrated gasification combined cycle'' power. (Yes, it needs a better name.) Current coal-fired power plants burn pulverized coal using a combustion process that hasn't changed in a half a century. The new approach turns coal into a gas similar to natural gas, which runs through a device similar to a jet engine. Such plants can achieve near-zero emissions of toxic material and chemicals that form smog, and they require about a third less coal than regular coal-fired power plants to produce an equal amount of energy, which means about a third lower greenhouse gases. Beyond that, the promising technology of ''sequestering'' carbon dioxide -- pumping it back into the ground to keep it out of atmosphere -- appears for technical reasons to be impractical for conventional pulverized-coal power plants. But gasification plants have technical characteristics that should make ''sequestration'' of carbon feasible. A gasification power plant with sequestration would have around two-thirds lower greenhouse gases than a conventional coal-fired generating station. The first commercial gasification power plant, designed by GENERAL ELECTRIC  for Duke Energy, is being built in Indiana. Yet, absurdly, most state public-utility commissions have denied requests  to construct these environmentally friendly systems. Last year,  Virginia denied a major utility's request to build a coal-fired power plant that would have sequestered nearly all its carbon output. […]",positive,2009,6,29
GENERAL ELECTRIC,Wind Farms Take Root Out at Sea,"BREMEN, Germany -- In a warehouse district on the outskirts of Bremen in northwestern Germany is a big, well-lighted work space dominated by the massive top section of a wind turbine called a nacelle. […] The turbines are formidably expensive and tricky to install and maintain, but countries blessed with ample sea breezes, like Britain and Germany, are coming to view them as a major part of their efforts to curb the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that scientists say contribute to climate change. […] Offshore wind has advantages beyond the presence of sea breezes. The seabed is relatively cheap real estate, and much larger wind farms can be built there than on land. The vast expanses available at sea allow economies of scale that may bring down costs. In addition, sea-based wind farms are less likely to set off aesthetic or environmental objections than land-based ones. Although there is worry that their fast-turning rotors may put seabirds at risk, particularly on foggy days, and grumbling that the big white pinwheels spoil views, they are being placed farther and farther out to sea to partly quell the complaints. Siemens acquired a foothold in the industry by buying the Danish company Bonus Energy in 2004. Since then, it has been scaling up the turbines and trying to streamline their installation. The company is a global leader in the offshore business, with 1,200 turbines fully installed and another 1,200 on order, costing several million euros each. Major competitors include GENERAL ELECTRIC, Vestas and Chinese companies. On an installation called Riffgat that Siemens is now finishing off Borkum, Germany, one of a chain of sandy islands that run along the German and Dutch coastlines, it managed to cut turbine installation times to 14 hours -- no small feat for units that have rotor diameters of 120 meters and weigh 250 tons.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,"Wind power is energy source of future, experts say: Canada lagging in technology, usage. Public concerns about greenhouse gases, smog has spurred companies to invest","Wind power could supply one-quarter of Canada's electricity before the middle of this century, says the new executive director of the Canadian Wind Energy Association. Robert Hornung believes the massive power outage that hit Ontario last week will give wind power a boost. ""People are waking up and saying: 'Hey, there's something wrong with the electricity system, and it sounds like we need to invest something to make it right,'"" Hornung told the Citizen. ""I think that if people are going to be asked to ante up to make investments, at the same time they're going to say: Why don't we work to make this whole thing better, and actually look at investing in some of the new technologies?""  Wind currently supplies less than half of one per cent of Canada's electricity - just 313 megawatts. By contrast, wind generates 25,000 megawatts of electricity in Europe, including 12,800 megawatts in Germany alone. The state of Texas has 1,500 megawatts of wind energy. To reach one-quarter of Canada's electricity needs, wind power would need to supply about 50,000 megawatts, which would mean building about 50,000 turbines. Though that goal appears ambitious, Hornung said major energy corporations are now taking wind seriously. NB Power, Saskpower, Shell Canada, GENERAL ELECTRIC Wind Energy, Hydro-Quebec and Manitoba Hydro are all members of the Canadian Wind Energy Association, taking the forces of green power out of hippies' backyards and into corporate boardrooms. Public concerns about urban smog from coal-powered plants, and the greenhouse gases caused by burning fossil fuels, have led companies to invest in wind and solar power. ""Renewables can be one-third of the world's energy resource,"" said Paula McGarricle, manager of renewables at Shell Canada.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,GE and China Form Clean Energy Joint Ventures,"On the eve of Chinese President Hu Jintao's state visit to the US, GENERAL ELECTRIC made a bilateral relations announcement of its own, signing a five-year, joint collaboration agreement with China Huadian Corp. for distributed energy combined heat and power (DECHP) projects in China. DECHP is said to be a more efficient use of natural gas and combined heat and power facilities are located at or closer to the consumers. GE said that DECHP will be an especially cost-effective use of natural gas for China and a significantly cleaner alternative to the higher greenhouse gases from coal-fired power plants, reducing CO2 emissions. The company anticipates that at least 50 gas turbine generator sets will be sold and installed in China, resulting in $500 million of total revenue for the collaboration. These efficient systems recover heat that normally would be wasted in an electricity generator and save the fuel that would otherwise be used to produce heat or steam in a separate unit, said Xianming Liu, general manager of CHEC New Energy Technology Development, an affiliated enterprise of China Huadian Corp. A report released in 7 by the World Alliance for Decentralized Energy (Wade) says that the US and China are behind Europe in deploying decentralized energy, but the potential for advancement is enormous for both countries. CHP and DE are so efficient because the current way of generating electricity wastes so much energy, said Wade Executive Director David Sweet at an event held in 7 in Washington, noting that by the time electricity has reached customers' homes, two-thirds of the primary energy value of fuel is lost. GE says that it has had great success with CHP. In 8, the company announced that one of its aeroderivative gas turbines is now powering the Texas Medical Center in Houston, one of the largest medical centers in the world. The medical center's first CHP plant, developed by Thermal Energy, uses a GE LM6000 PD Sprint aeroderivative gas turbine, providing 48 MW of power (NGW Jan.25,p13).

They said that the project could be completed at a cost of between £7 billion to £9 billion, or an average of £269 to £346 per household. Ernst & Young, the audit firm, has rejected that estimate, arguing that the true cost would be at least 49 per cent higher, at about £13.4 billion, or £515 per household. Consumers are expected to shoulder the bulk of the extra cost in the form of higher bills, although the industry claims there will be offsetting savings.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Where The Jobs Aren't,"With the economy stagnating and unemployment high, where are the jobs of the future going to come from? A few years ago, it seemed as though the Green Economy could be a big part of the answer. New clean-energy sources could address environmental, economic and national security problems all at once. In his 2008 convention speech, Barack Obama promised to create five million green economy jobs. The U.S. Conference of Mayors estimated in April 2009 that green jobs could account for 10 percent of new job growth over the next 30 years. […] There's a wealth of other evidence to suggest that the green economy will not be a short-term jobs machine.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,"Bye-bye, incandescent bulb?","Is Thomas Edison's most famous invention, the incandescent light bulb, about to fizzle into obscurity? Thanks to global warming, the ban-the-bulb movement is gaining strength. Australian officials and European lighting manufacturers have announced phaseouts of the energy-draining bulb. A California legislator has proposed a ban. Now, in a move that could speed the move away from the 128-year-old invention, some of the world's largest bulbmakers have joined environmental groups and the California Energy Commission in talks that could lead to a phaseout in the US within a decade, sources say. The scope of the move - and manufacturers' support of it - is still undecided, they add. ""We're talking about a 10-year phaseout of incandescents, but there's no plan on paper on how to do that yet,"" says a source close to the talks who, lacking authorization to speak to media, asked not to be identified. ""We're thinking through and seeking answers to a number of questions,"" said the source, noting the talks could yet fail. […] But the venerable incandescent may have life in it yet. GENERAL ELECTRIC Co. said Friday that by 2010 it would make an incandescent bulb twice as efficient as today's - and by 2012 produce one that is four times more efficient, on par with CFLs.

You've probably also guessed that GE's ""ecoimagination"" line doesn't really include turtle traffic or flatulent grass-fed dragons. GE's ads feature rich, mythical landscapes, inviting viewers to ""imagine"" a green-fueled future that is ""no longer the stuff of legends."" The truth behind the legend is a little less glamorous, but it would be animal cruelty if the two dragon-awed tots fed the fire-breathing beast baskets of chicken poop. Here's the real story behind the ""legends"" conjured by GE:  ""Wind hasn't always played a helpful role in the Olympic Games, but today, wind energy from GE is helping power the Beijing games."" REAL STORY: GE provided 120 wind turbines to the Zhangbei and Shangyi wind farms north of Beijing, supplying 180 megawatts of electricity, about one-tenth of the electric capacity of Tampa Electric's Big Bend power station. The wind power feeds the electric grid in Beijing, a city of 16-million people, and two nearby cities. GE estimates that the farms can power nearly 400,000 Chinese households per year.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Chargemaster sets controls to charge as it drives to market,"The company responsible for the production and installation of half of Britain's charging points for electric cars is set to join the stock market. Chargemaster, set up by David Martell - who made his first fortune founding the Trafficmaster satnav system - is proposing to float on AIM this month.  The listing comes as the company plans to take advantage of a big leap in public subsidy for the installation of charging points at home, in the workplace and in public places, as the Government tries to kick-start the take-up of electric cars. The lack of public charging points is thought to be a key reason for the slow sales of zero-emission cars. Mr Martell believes that the industry is on the cusp of breaking through, however, with governments across Europe creating incentives and Britain raising funding for charging points from £4 million a year to about £18 million. European Union rules will demand that motor manufacturers cut the average emissions of their vehicles to 130g/km in 2015 and to 95g/km (roughly the present emission of the Toyota Prius hybrid) by 2020, meaning that all carmakers will have to invest in electric or hybrid models or face fines. […] Chargemaster is in a market where the big industrial technology players. such as Siemens, GENERAL ELECTRIC and ABB, have yet to make a big impact. Industry-watchers reckon that they are waiting for the likes of Chargemaster, and about half a dozen similar companies, to make the commercial breakthrough before snapping them up. Founded in the 1980s, Trafficmaster floated in 1994. It was valued around the turn of the millennium at more than £1 billion. Mr Martell made his exit with a multimillion-pound fortune in 2004.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,The Master of Wind,"If Jim Dehlsen ever needs to remind himself why, at 67, he's still trying to save the world, all he has to do is glance outside his window. The offices of his three-year-old firm, Clipper Windpower, look across California's tranquil Santa Barbara Channel and, in the distance, to the remote marine sanctuary of Santa Cruz Island. Marring that view are eight oil rigs jutting into the ocean mist. In 1969 a well underneath one platform ruptured, releasing 200,000 gallons of crude into the harbor, coating beaches and killing thousands of birds. Today the oil rigs represent to Dehlsen America's dependence on fossil fuels. ""We're not only depleting those resources but reaching the limits of what the planet can absorb, in terms of emissions,"" he says. ""And that is clearing the way for the return of wind power."" Not long ago wind power was the domain of fringe scientists and environmentalists. In the 1970s the idea of harvesting the wind's kinetic energy and converting it into electrons was impractical: the first rickety, garage-built turbines often self-destructed in storms. The industry grew in the '80s and '90s, but wind was still too costly, generating power at more than 10 cents per kilowatt hour, versus less than five cents for coal and other fossil fuels. Even today, wind power feeds less than half of 1 percent of America's ravenous energy appetite, and about 5 percent of Germany's and Spain's. But the industry is maturing and growing quickly--and is beginning to find its place as one viable element in the energy puzzle. Dehlsen is one of its pioneers. His first wind company, Zond--founded in 1980 and sold to Enron in 1997--was synonymous with many early breakthroughs. The firm was the first to add wind energy to the California electricity grid and to bring scientific rigor to the locating of wind farms and the development of wind turbines. In recent years much bigger companies like GENERAL ELECTRIC, which bought what was left of Zond after Enron imploded, have entered the field. With rapidly improving technology and major corporate muscle behind wind power, costs are falling: wind contracts now average three cents per kilowatt hour (with tax subsi-dies), cheaper than coal and comparable to natural gas and oil. Because the wind is uncontrolled--it doesn't always blow--the challenge is to drive costs down further. Still, says Bob Thresher of the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Lab, ""wind is the first renewable technology that is very nearly competitive in the market for bulk power generation.""

GENERAL ELECTRIC,How The G.O.P. Goes Green,"It is early evening on Capitol Hill, and I am sitting with Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, who, along with John Kerry and Joe Lieberman, is trying to craft a new energy bill -- one that could actually win 60 votes. What is interesting about Graham is that he has been willing -- courageously in my view -- to depart from the prevailing G.O.P. consensus that the only energy policy we need is ''drill, baby, drill.'' What brought you around, I ask? Graham's short answer: politics, jobs and legacy. We start with politics. The Republican Party today has a major outreach problem with two important constituencies, ''Hispanics and young people,'' Graham explains: ''I have been to enough college campuses to know if you are 30 or younger this climate issue is not a debate. It's a value. These young people grew up with recycling and a sensitivity to the environment  --  and the world will be better off for it. They are not brainwashed. ... From a Republican point of view, we should buy into it and embrace it and not belittle them. You can have a genuine debate about the science of climate change, but when you say that those who believe it are buying a hoax and are wacky people you are putting at risk your party's future with younger people. You can have a legitimate dispute about how to solve immigration, but when you start focusing on the last names of people the demographics will pass you by.'' So Graham's approach to bringing around his conservative state has been simple: avoid talking about ''climate change,'' which many on the right don't believe. Instead, frame our energy challenge as a need to ''clean up carbon pollution,'' to ''become energy independent'' and to ''create more good jobs and new industries for South Carolinians.'' He proposes ''putting a price on carbon,'' starting with a very focused carbon tax, as opposed to an economywide cap-and-trade system, so as to spur both consumers and industries to invest in and buy new clean energy products. He includes nuclear energy, and insists on permitting more offshore drilling for oil and gas to give us more domestic sources, as we bridge to a new clean energy economy.  ''Cap-and-trade as we know it is dead, but the issue of cleaning up the air and energy independence should not die --  and you will never have energy independence without pricing carbon,'' Graham argues. ''The technology doesn't make sense until you price carbon. Nuclear power is a bet on cleaner air. Wind and solar is a bet on cleaner air. You make those bets assuming that cleaning the air will become more profitable than leaving the air dirty, and the only way it will be so is if the government puts some sticks on the table -- not just carrots. The future economy of America and the jobs of the future are going to be tied to cleaning up the air, and in the process of cleaning up the air this country becomes energy independent and our national security is greatly enhanced.'' Remember, he adds: ''We are more dependent on foreign oil today than after 9/11. That is political malpractice, and every member of Congress is responsible.'' This isn't just for the next generation, says Graham: ''As you talk about the future, if you forget the people who live in the present, you will have no future politically. You have to get the people in the present to buy into the future. I tell my voters: 'If we try to clean up the air and become energy independent, we will create more jobs than anything I can do as a senator.'

PROCTER & GAMBLE,Provisions in bill 'problematic',"CORPORATE governance doyen Mervyn King raised concerns about some provisions of the new Companies Bill on Friday, calling them ""problematic"". King said the provisions did not lay down qualifications for audit committee members. […] The Swedish government had inextricably woven sustainability issues into state-owned enterprises, the Norwegian government had compiled a white paper on sustainability, while sustainability was central to the policies of US President Barack Obama's administration. King said companies had become greater agents for change than governments, and directors and executives were increasingly aware that a company's activities had a huge effect on the planet. Groups such as PROCTER & GAMBLE were developing consumer products designed to be less harmful to the planet, such as biodegradable disposable nappies.

After a year of trials, Wal-Mart buyers officially started using the scorecard in the US as a tool for making purchasing decisions and rating suppliers' progress on developing sustainable packaging. More than 97,000 products, from 6,371 different vendors, had been entered into the scheme, which is part of the retailer's plans to cut packaging by 5% by 2013. The scheme scores a pack's performance in nine areas, including greenhouse gas emissions and material value. Asda, Wal-Mart's UK arm, has said it wants to roll out a UK version of the scorecard from early 2009. Asda has also claimed that packaging reduction will enable it to reduce the price of its own-brand products by a total of pounds 10m in 2008, under its Green Rollbacks scheme. Asda's packaging team will review all of its own-label products - some 500 lines - and, from May, the store will cut prices on goods that have had their packaging reduced.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,My Say: The climate change revolution,"The world is in the midst of a great political transformation, in which climate change has moved to the centre of national and global politics. For politicians in persistent denial about the need to act, including US President George W Bush, Australian Prime Minister John Howard, and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, there is no longer any place to hide. The science is clear - man-made changes in climate are being felt, and the electorate's demand for action is growing. Though unlikely just a few months ago, a strong global agreement by 2010, one that will set a path for action for decades to come, now stands a good chance of being implemented. […] This year, the IPCC is releasing its fourth round of reports, starting with the one issued in early February. That report was unequivocal: there is a powerful scientific consensus that human activity, mainly the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas), as well as deforestation and other land uses (such as growing paddy), leads to massive emissions of carbon dioxide into the air. This is causing climate change, which is accelerating and posing serious risks to the planet. The single biggest threat comes from the production and consumption of energy for electricity, transport, and heating and cooling buildings. But the world's scientists and engineers, as well as global technology leaders such as GENERAL ELECTRIC, are also sending a clear message: we can solve the problem at modest cost if we put our best thinking and action into real solutions. By shifting to alternative energy sources, economising on energy use, and capturing and safely storing the carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuels, global society can limit its emissions of carbon dioxide to prudent levels at an estimated cost of under 1% of global income. The changeover to a sustainable energy system will not come quickly, and will require new kinds of electrical power plants, new kinds of automobiles, and ""green buildings"", which economise on energy use. The process will take decades, but we must start now and act on a global basis, using carbon taxes and emission permits to create market-based incentives for companies and individuals to make the necessary changes. Those incentives will come at modest cost and huge benefit, and they can be designed to protect the poor and shift the climate-change burden to those who can afford it. […]",positive,2007,2,26

According to top-level sustainability executives at some of the plastics industry's biggest customers, the new must-knows are alternative energy sources, future environmental regulations, and consumer lifestyle changes that will drive future original equipment manufacturers decisions about which suppliers they choose. […] ``Some of the brand owners are actually viewing some of the sustainability benefits as a new opportunity to market and sell products. Historically ... [Dow has] been asked to come on and help the economics of their packaging materials but at the same time now, we're focusing on more of the sustainability and environmental impacts.'' The marketplace is a shifting sandpit of expectations, and standards, with no common solution to sustainability concerns, executives agreed. Mark Kitzis, global account vice president at Alcan Packaging, said in 2006, when Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s sustainable packaging scorecard was new, Wal-Mart's sustainability initiatives were a standard reference for OEMs. That has changed. ``Some are trying to meet Wal-Mart's requirements [but] with the economy where it's been, we've seen a lot of our customers moving away from some of the bio solutions because of the costs and instead focusing on reducing and resizing.'' […] The sustainability panel included executives from some of the world's biggest plastic film buyers, including Kellogg, Frito-Lay North American Inc. and Sara Lee Corp. Brad Rodgers, Frito-Lay's manager of sustainable packaging and advanced material research, said his company is expanding its efforts with suppliers to include their suppliers, for a more cost-effective and earth-friendly approach all along the chain.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Exxon-Led Group Is Giving A Climate Grant to Stanford ,"Four big international companies, including the oil giant Exxon Mobil, said yesterday that they would give Stanford University $225 million over 10 years for research on ways to meet growing energy needs without worsening global warming. […] The initiative is a small step toward what a diverse group of scientists, writing recently in the journal Science, said must be an enormous effort to find clean energy sources for an expected tripling of global demands by midcentury. In addition to Exxon Mobil, the contributors are General Electric, which said it would give $50 million; E.ON, a large German energy company with nuclear and conventional power plants, giving $50 million; and Schlumberger, the oil-field technology company, giving $25 million. Environmental campaigners noted that Exxon Mobil told investors last month that it was plowing $100 billion over the next decade into a search for new oil and gas reserves. The money for climate research is ""only one-tenth of 1 percent of what Exxon Mobil will spend over the same time exploring and developing new sources of oil and gas,"" said Pete Altman, the coordinator of a shareholder group pressing to change the company's environmental practices.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Judge Blocks Shipment of Oil Equipment Through Idaho Forest,"SEATTLE -- A federal judge ordered a halt on Friday to more shipments of immense loads of oil field equipment through a national forest in north-central Idaho, pending a broad review of effects on the route.  The review will be conducted by the United States Forest Service in consultation with the Nez Perce Indians, whose tribal rights and lands near the forest route were central to the judge's ruling. The case was brought by the Nez Perce tribe and an environmental group, Idaho Rivers United, charging that the Forest Service had failed to enforce its own rules and standards in protecting the forest and a river corridor through which a first shipment, known as a megaload and bound for Canada's tar sands oil fields, was sent last month. A second shipment was scheduled for next week. The loads are more than 250 feet long and weigh about 644,000 pounds. […] The equipment supplier, Resources Conservation Company International, an affiliate of GENERAL ELECTRIC, said in a statement that the injunction delayed delivery of machinery that could save billions of gallons a year in water, which is used in vast amounts in the type of oil recovery used at the tar sands. The company also said it was reviewing its options. ''There are significant environmental benefits associated with these particular shipments,'' the company said. […]",positive,2013,9,14

AMAZON.COM,"What's Outside Counts, Too: British Law Spurs Scrutiny of Excess Packaging","[…] British regulations on excess packaging first took effect in 2003 in an effort to reduce waste, particularly items that cannot be recycled and go into a landfill. Those rules, strengthened two years ago in response to environmental concerns and an awareness that the nation's landfills were reaching their limits, now require that producers keep packaging to the minimum required for ''products' safety, hygiene and consumer acceptance.''[…] Landfills are an environmental concern partly because rotting trash releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Landfill taxes on unnecessary and excessive packaging will cost local governments about $4 billion per year, according to a study by the Local Government Association. Studies suggest that households could avoid generating more than half the waste that they produce. In the United States, the federal Environmental Protection Agency also encourages efforts to reduce packaging and household waste, but through low-key exhortation rather than inspections and regulations. The United States, unlike Britain, imposes no special federal tax on landfills, and weaker regulation makes it easier to expand them. Still, some companies like Wal-Mart and AMAZON.com are taking steps to trim their packaging for items sold in the United States. In Britain, excess packaging rules are policed by the Trade Standards Agency, whose local officers investigate consumer complaints like the ones that got the beef in trouble, as well as issues like counterfeiting.[…]",positive,2010,12,26
PEPSICO,Wal-Mart plans huge move into organic food,"Organic Rice Krispies, organic Frosted Mini Wheats and even organic PEPSI may define the future of American eating habits after Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, revealed plans for a huge expansion into pesticide-free foods. The all-powerful supermarket chain argued that its shift would democratise organic food in the US, bringing it within reach of shoppers who could not afford to pay a 20% or 30% premium. But critics say the effect will be to force down organic standards, squeeze farmers' incomes, and undermine health benefits. With up to 100,000 product lines, and almost 2,000 ""supercentres"" with an average floor space of 17,400 square metres (187,000 sq ft), Wal-Mart's decisions in large part determine the activities of big US food producers. Kellogg and Kraft are already working on organic versions of their products, PEPSI is planning organic products for later this year, and General Mills, which makes cereals such as Cheerios and Cocoa Puffs, will follow suit. ""Environmental sustainability . . . will have huge impacts on the way things are made, farmed, packaged, transported, displayed and sold worldwide,"" the company's chief executive, Lee Scott, wrote recently. The chain has been stung by crit icism of its record in social responsibility - notably in the documentary Wal-Mart: the High Cost of Low Price - and recently opened two stores partly powered by wind turbines and solar panels. Its current move is more likely to have been motivated, however, by a recognition that organic food is now big business in the US. Though it accounts for only 2.4% of overall food sales, it has been growing at 15% a year or more, and is worth $14bn (£7.4bn). But an expansion by Wal-Mart could wreck the market, argued Ronnie Cummins, director of the US Organic Consumers Association.

INTEL,MANY STATES GIVE POLLUTING FIRMS NEW PROTECTIONS,"Urged on by a coalition of big industries, one state after another is adopting legislation to protect companies from disclosure or punishment when they discover environmental offenses at their own plants. The idea, advocates of the legislation say, is to encourage companies to monitor their own activities rigorously without fear that what they discover will be used against them. But opponents, including prosecutors, environmentalists, labor unions and lawyers for victims of pollution, say that polluters will exploit the laws to avoid adverse publicity and responsibility for illegal acts.   Alarmed by the trend, the Clinton Administration is warning that if states go too far to protect companies, it will withhold the authority that is commonly delegated to states to enforce Federal laws like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. All the important environmental statutes delegate enforcement to the states as long as the states meet Federal standards.[…] But even some big companies have opposed the proposals in favor of working with the E.P.A. to create other pollution-control strategies, rather than becoming adversarial. In Arizona, for instance, the INTEL Corporation came out against the proposed bill, saying the company preferred the E.P.A.'s approach. As the bills have been enacted in one state after another, some members of Congress have sought to put a similar provision into Federal law. It was tacked onto a spending bill in the House, but it was among the policy riders that were stripped when environmentalists protested.[…]",positive,1996,4,7
GENERAL ELECTRIC,G.E. moves to go greener with fleet of electric cars;  Ambitious plan to shrink carbon footprint is also a boon for General Motors,"GENERAL ELECTRIC announced an ambitious plan Thursday to reduce its carbon footprint - and support its new business in electric vehicle chargers. The company said it would buy 25,000 electric vehicles by 2015, including 12,000 from General Motors, starting with the Chevrolet Volt next year.  The Volt is technically a plug-in hybrid with a limited all-electric range. G.E. said it would convert ''at least half'' of its global fleet of 30,000 vehicles to electric cars, and would also act as a partner with fleet customers. The plan was originally announced in London last month by G.E.'s chairman and chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, but the company has now released details. G.E. said it would add other companies to its order list ''as manufacturers expand their electric vehicle portfolios.'' According to Bloomberg BusinessWeek, Mr. Immelt also said in London that half of the company's 45,000 sales force would drive electric cars.

The scientific nature of the carbon audit allows Backsberg to understand the magnitude of the sequestration solutions it needs to seek and develop, in order to reduce its carbon footprint and maintain a status of carbon neutrality going forward. The sequestration solutions developed by Backsberg will involve a greening programme within the nearby village of Klapmuts. This programme will be managed by the internationally respected Jeunesse Park, CEO of Food and Trees for Africa, the nonprofit national greening organisation driving the carbon-standard offset programme in SA. This collaboration will see Backsberg use the Food and Trees for Africa Carbon Standard logo.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Support for energy from waste is long overdue,"It largely slipped under the radar, but back in February the government directed the Ontario Power Authority to set up a program that would support the early development of energy-from-waste facilities in the province. Energy Minister Gerry Phillips, in a letter addressed to power authority chief executive Jan Carr, cited the need to test and evaluate new technologies that can turn municipal solid waste into electricity. Already, he pointed out, the government has streamlined the environmental approvals needed to build and operate such demonstration plants. ""The goal of the initiative is to encourage the development of new or improved energy-from-waste technologies with improved environmental performance,"" wrote Phillips, hinting that the power authority should be prepared to pay 10 cents per kilowatt-hour for any demonstration project that falls within the initiative.  It's a long overdue move for a technology with significant potential. We're not talking incineration here, despite attempts by critics to brand it as such. There's no burning involved. What the technology does is use intense heat to break down the molecular structure of the waste. Once this is done, bad molecules are removed and the rest is chemically engineered into clean-burning synthetic gas - similar to natural gas. This ""gasification"" process is not squeaky clean, but it's better than the alternatives it aims to replace, including landfills on the waste side and coal on the energy side. […] The fact that GENERAL ELECTRIC is getting into the energy-from-waste business is, on its own, a telling sign that the technology has matured. […]",positive,2008,5,26

MPs cleared the Bill with a huge majority after ministers moved to include greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation and shipping in carbon cutting targets. […] It's now easier for businesses to assess the carbon footprint of their goods and services with the help of a newstandard launched by BSI British Standards, the Carbon Trust and Defra.  The standard - called PAS 2050 - is a consistent way of counting the greenhouse gas emissions embedded in goods and services throughout their entire life cycle - from sourcing raw materials, through tomanufacture, distribution, use and disposal.  The aimof the new standard is to help businesses move beyond managing the emissions their own processes create and to look at the opportunities for reducing emissions in the design, making and supplying of products.  The Government hopes this will then help businesses make goods or services which are less carbonintensive and develop new products with lower carbon footprints.   The Carbon Trust has already piloted PAS 2050 with 75 product ranges across a wide range of companies including PEPSICO, Boots, Innocent and Tesco.

ULSD is better for the environment because it produces less poisonous sulphur dioxide fumes and less black smoke containing carcinogenic particulates. With some of the most polluted air in western Europe, the drive to freshen up Belfast city is an urgent one but, for the meantime, consumers have little opportunity to buy the cleaner, greener diesel. The reason is that although BP, the largest supplier of fuel in Northern Ireland, is producing ULSD, it isn't bringing it in here and may not be until September. But motorists eager to do their bit for the environment can, if they're prepared to look around as Raymond Reihill of local firm Kelly Fuels explained yesterday.

PFIZER,"Take Viagra, save a reindeer; Impotence drug may reduce the harvesting of wildlife","At an herbal shop on Arch Street in Chinatown, owners report sluggish sales of a red, powdered medicine called ""Strong Man."" On the docks of Newfoundland, fishermen are finding it harder to peddle the private parts of seals. And on the plains of western Alaska, the trade in reindeer antlers has plummeted. A possible reason behind all three, according to researchers: Viagra.  The popular impotence drug may be reducing demand for traditional Chinese impotence remedies, many of which contain ground-up animal parts. So Viagra may be helping to save world wildlife. The evidence, say researchers Frank and William von Hippel, is that sales of reindeer antlers dropped sharply about the same time Viagra came on the market, in 1998. While antlers were among the products studied because they are legally traded and easy to monitor, there is some early indication that the Viagra effect also holds true for endangered and threatened species, ranging from sea horses to green turtles. Environmental groups say they hope it's true, but animal experts say the impact on reindeer is plausible. Pleased that its flagship product may work wonders both in the bedroom and in the realm of animal conservation, Viagra-maker PFIZER gave the researchers $25,000 for additional study in Hong Kong. Frank von Hippel, a University of Alaska biologist, and his brother, a psychologist in New Zealand, published their most recent paper on the subject, ""Sex, drugs and animal parts: Will Viagra save threatened species?"", in the September issue of Environmental Conservation.[…]",positive,2002,12,15

Plutonic and GE are working together on several run-of-river projects north of Vancouver. (A run-of-river system does not require a large reservoir to provide power.)  About $100-million has been sunk into the EarthFirst wind project. An earlier EarthFirst budget suggested it will cost another $250-million to complete.

PEPSICO,PEPSICO and Sainsbury's extend sustainability work with farmers,"PEPSICO is rolling out new agricultural sustainability targets, while Sainsbury's and Morrisons are extending their on-farm initiatives. Efforts by food makers and retailers to improve the sustainability of the UK farms supplying them continue to spread. PEPSICO announced ambitious new targets in October, and Morrisons and Sainsbury's recently extended their farm-outreach programmes.  For most food and drink products it is the agricultural stage of their life cycle that has the biggest environmental impact. This makes it a key target for manufacturers and retailers trying to reduce their products' carbon and water footprints (see table).  With the government applying only gentle pressure on farmers to cut greenhouse gas emissions, there is much scope for improvement (ENDS Report 428, pp38-42).   The aims and approaches of different corporate programmes vary, but most involve benchmarking and sharing best practice.  PEPSICO, which makes Walkers crisps, Quaker Oats and Copella juices in the UK, has set itself firmer targets than most. It aims to work with the 350 farmers it buys oats, apples and potatoes from to cut carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions by 50% by 2015. It also wants to reduce the 'water impact' of farms in water-stressed areas by 50% by the same date. The baseline for both targets is 2010. […]  Sainsbury's, which held a conference on the future of farming with 1,000 farmers at the end of October, set up its first farm development group, focused on dairy, three years ago. It has spent pounds 15m on the group so far and has just pledged another pounds 40m for the next three years.

COCA COLA,Action speaks louder than hot air; Geoffrey Lean in cancun,"It passed almost unnoticed, but an apparently unexciting business announcement on the very first day of the Cancun climate summit may well do more to combat global warming than the two weeks of talks that followed. This is not just because it amounted to rare action amid the millions of words spoken, written and printed on enough paper to require the felling of a small forest - but because it represents an early move in a new, more effective strategy to avert dangerous climate change. Four hundred leading companies - including Tesco, Unilever, Coca-Cola, Kraft, Walmart, Procter and Gamble and L'Oréal - said they would be switching refrigerants within the next five years. Important to them, you might think, but not the sort of thing to stir the blood unless you're the type of person that finds coolants really cool. But bear with me. The chemicals, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), are greenhouse gases. Yet even that is not the point.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,PSC staff supports new Turkey Point reactors,"The Florida Public Service Commission staff recommended March 10 that PSC commissioners approve Florida Power & Light Co.'s petition for a determination of need for two new nuclear units at Turkey Point. Before new electric generating capacity can be built in Florida, the PSC must determine that it is needed. The staff recommendation is scheduled to be discussed at the commission's March 18 hearing.  The staff recommended that the commission approve the proposed Turkey Pont-6 and -7 reactors to maintain the utility's fuel diversity and to provide adequate electricity at a reasonable cost over the long term. Turkey Point-3 and -4 are the existing reactors at the site.  The staff noted that there are some uncertainties over the cost of the new units. However, it said, FPL's analysis indicates Turkey Point-6 and -7 ""have a high likelihood of providing net savings to FPL's customers over a variety of fuel and environmental cost scenarios."" FPL has said the cost for building the two units ranges from $12.1 billion to $17.8 billion for Westinghouse's 1,100-MW AP1000, and $16.5 billion to $24.3 billion for GENERAL ELECTRIC's 1,520-MW ESBWR. The staff said Turkey Point-6 and -7 are projected to produce savings in 17 of the 18 scenarios FPL considered. Those results indicate a high likelihood of FPL's ratepayers realizing net benefits over the life of the project, it said. And, it said, as environmental compliance costs increase, so do the benefits associated with Turkey Point-6 and -7 because nuclear generation is considered a non-emitting technology for greenhouse gas emissions.

BANK OF AMERICA,A FOREST CLEARING; The UN wants rich countries to pay poor nations to halt deforestation and cut emissions. Is either side interested?,"[…] Flora & Fauna International, a British environmental group, is helping the governor of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, to develop a Redd project to protect 750,000 hectares of forest around the Ulu Masen mountain. The BANK OF AMERICA has promised to buy £5.6 million-worth of carbon credits from the project, but only if FFI can prove that trees are being preserved that would otherwise be lost, and if it has obtained the consent of indigenous people. FFI says that ""ideally"" it will demarcate areas where trees can be cut for local needs. But it says that it will take another year or more simply to establish who owns the land. One of the biggest challenges for the Ulu Masen project is defining the baseline deforestation rate. This is difficult because there was little land development during the civil war in Aceh. Normal activity was disrupted again by the 2004 tsunami that killed more than 150,000 people there.[…] Matt Linkie, a zoologist and FFI's project manager for Ulu Masen, acknowledges that unless the rules governing Redd are tightly drawn and enforced it will have little credibility. ""Potentially we could let some of the world's biggest polluters off by offering them carbon permits,"" he says. ""But what's the alternative to Redd?

However, more than the benefits it brings to their immediate environment, early adaptors know that betting on the green craze has also become good for business. Helping these ventures go pro-environment are new fiscal and non- fiscal initiatives, such as seven-year income tax holidays for renewable energy developers; reduced corporate income tax to 10% after their income tax holiday expires; duty-free importation of equipment and machinery; and a zero percent VAT rate for power sourced from renewable energy. [...]According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)_Philippines' 10-year sustainable energy road map, the country can save as much as $2.3 billion if it taps renewable energy sources. Further, a shift to wind, geothermal, solar and biomass resources will result in lower power costs for consumers in the long run.[...]Dennis Posadas, Cleantech Asia Online editor and BusinessWorld columnist, believes that part of the gamble stems from a lack of supporting data.

If the source is geothermal, then this type of renewable energy is often driven by big companies like CHEVRON. If the energy source is solar, wind or biomass, then smaller entities can come in,"" he added.[...] ""The drive for renewable energy was influenced by the rise of crude oil prices in the '70s, but was dropped later.

GOOGLE,NRG Seeks to Cut 90% of Its Carbon Emissions,"NRG, which built a leading electricity business from coal and other conventional power plants, is aiming to reduce its carbon emissions 50 percent by 2030 and 90 percent by 2050, the company said on Thursday. David Crane, the company's chief executive, made the announcement at a ceremony breaking ground for the company's new headquarters in Princeton, N.J., conceived as a green-energy showcase that will open in 2016. ''The power industry is the biggest part of the problem of greenhouse gas emissions, but it has the potential to be an even bigger part of the solution,'' Mr. Crane said in an interview before the announcement.  Since 2005, the company has reduced its carbon emissions 40 percent, executives say, and the new goals would use this year's projected level of 125 million metric tons as a baseline. Few power companies have made similar commitments, although they have become common in corporate America and are part of the impetus for NRG's move.

Introduced in time for the iPhone 6 release later this year, the trade-in scheme accepts all but the first-generation iPhone 3G and iPad 1 - with Apple store staff assessing the returned device's age and condition before determining the trade-in value. It is not possible to trade in a current model iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C or iPad Air for a discount on a replacement.  Traded-in devices are either refurbished and sold online at a 15 per cent discount, or else recycled. The ""Reuse and Recycling"" scheme is part of Apple's efforts to improve its green credentials, following the recent announcement that all Australian Apple stores now rely on renewable energy, along with more than 140 stores in the United States.

CHEVRON,In search of fuel's holy grail; Companies in Canada are closing in on a profitable way to turn wood waste into ethanol to use as an alternative to gasoline. SHAWN McCARTHY reports on their progress,"Biochemist Kendall Pye has devoted his long career to the modern equivalent of the alchemist's dream: a commercially viable process for transforming forest wastes into cellulosic ethanol that could replace gasoline. […] Now, with high oil prices and environmental concerns again driving a search for alternative fuels, Dr. Pye, 69, is back in the lab, pursuing the keys to profitable cellulosic ethanol as the chief scientific officer at Lignol Energy Corp., a Vancouver-based company he co-founded several years ago. […] The U.S. government is promoting the ethanol as a replacement for gasoline, both for its claimed environmental benefits in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and as a replacement for imported oil. President George W. Bush, who has warned of the U.S. ""addiction"" to imported oil, set a target of 35 billion gallons of ethanol in use by 2017, which represents 30 per cent of current American gasoline consumption. In Canada, both the federal government and the provinces have set ethanol standards, ranging from 5 to 10 per cent of the motor-fuel market. To get there, experts agree, the vast expansion of corn- and wheat-based ethanol will have to be augmented by the cellulosic variety, which can be made from straw, corn stover, switchgrass, wood or even municipal waste. Not only are those biomass feedstocks more abundant than grain, the reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions are far superior over the life cycle of their production and consumption, scientists with the U.S. and Canadian governments have concluded.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,GE to invest in 282 MW of wind projects due online by year end in New York,"GE Energy Financial Services plans to invest in three wind farms totaling 282 MW in New York being developed by Noble Environmental Power. The plants are due to begin operating by year end and have a value of $564 million, according to the Stamford, Connecticut, subsidiary of GENERAL ELECTRIC. GE EFS is not disclosing details of its investment, said spokesman Ken Koprowski, but it said the transaction gives EFS stakes in 30 wind farms, with ownership equity of more than 2,000 MW (in which it has invested or committed to invest). When it purchased some wind assets in Texas in May, GE EFS said its wind equity holdings were around 1,900 MW. In the transaction with Noble, GE EFS would invest in the Class A equity as the non-managing member, while Noble would hold the Class B equity as the managing member. Noble is the developer and has been the sole equity holder, Koprowski said. To enable GE EFS to invest, the company created a second equity class, of which GE owns 100%. Noble is developing one project of 100.5 MW in Bliss, Wyoming County, in western New York, and two in Clinton County, in the northeastern part of the state. Those will be located in Clinton (100.5 MW) and Ellenburg (81 MW). The company, based in Essex, Connecticut, expects to bring the turbines into service in the fourth quarter. Noble is majority owned by JP Morgan Partners. Noble has already arranged to sell 95% of the renewable energy certificates generated by the projects to the New York State Energy and Research Development Authority, under 10-year contracts. NYSERDA would use these to help meet the state's Renewable Portfolio Standard, which requires 25% of the state's power to come from green energy by 2013 (including large hydro stations already in place). In New York, utilities and retail marketers do not seek their own supplies to meet the RPS mandate; instead, NYSERDA periodically holds bid solicitations for renewable power. […]",positive,2007,6,28

GENERAL ELECTRIC,"Governors press for 'clean energy,' even as some acknowledge strain","The National Governors Association used its winter meeting in Washington last week to heighten its call for adoption of ""clean"" alternatives to oil, natural gas and coal to strengthen US energy security and reduce carbon emissions. But worries among coal states over the impact of such policies on their economies were evident throughout the three-day conference. ""Governors and states are stepping forward to lead an energy revolution that will 'Americanize' our energy production in order to improve our national security, our economic well-being and our quality of life,"" NGA Chairman and Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty said at the opening of the meeting. Pawlenty, who last year made ""Securing a Clean Energy Future"" the theme of his one-year term with the association, called on his colleagues to support a diversified list of options for making the US more energy secure, from coal and nuclear energy to alternative fuels and energy efficiency. His and other states have surpassed Washington in setting standards for electricity from renewable energy and for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. […] GENERAL ELECTRIC CEO Jeffrey Immelt told the governors that they should use their state's markets to promote energy options such as wind and solar energy, adding that renewable portfolio standards have been effective in electricity markets. Immelt also said supporting a broad range of energy options, including coal and nuclear energy, is critical to not only US energy security but also to economic development. He said advanced coal and nuclear technologies, some of which GE sells or is developing, ""ought to be one of the great export industries of this country."" As he has before, Immelt called for national program to reduce carbon emissions, saying they would help his company and others in the US develop and sell innovative technologies for electricity generation and other markets, here and abroad. ""At some point, our nation needs to set national standards,"" he said. Such thinking underlies GE's ""ecomagination"" campaign, which the company launched three years ago to concentrate on products with less environmental impacts, he said. Some governors were critical of the federal government regarding energy policy, saying it lags the states. ""Here in Washington DC we have leaders talking,"" Montana Governor Brian Sweitzer, a Democrat, said. ""Out in the states, we have governors acting. Maybe they can take a few notes from us."" ""We think of this as one of the most important things we can do in the 21st Century,"" Colorado Governor Bill Ritter Jr., a Democrat, said. Likewise, New York Times Pulitizer Prize-winning columnist Thomas Friedman said lack of political leadership is impeding technological advances in energy. ""We still don't have leaders with political visions to put systems into place that would truly drive innovation,"" Friedman told the governors. ""We have energy politics in this country,"" he added.

PROCTER & GAMBLE,The dish on phosphates,"That white, cloudy residue and streaking that has been showing up on your freshly washed dishes lately doesn't necessarily mean your dishwasher needs to be replaced. The culprit is more likely to be the detergent, thanks to a little-publicized federal ban on phosphate, a popular cleaning ingredient that leaves dishes and glasses with that sparkly shine. ""There has been no public campaign to advise people that this has happened,"" said Bruce Cran, president of the Consumers Association of Canada.  The federal government brought in new regulations last 7 effectively banning phosphorus in most household cleaning products, such as dishwashing and laundry detergents. The new rules prohibit the manufacture and import of these products containing phosphorus beyond 0.5% by weight. Similar regulations in the United States banned the chemical in 17 states. But the government and industry failed to adequately inform the public of the change, says Mr. Cran, leaving frustrated homeowners wondering why their dishes aren't coming out of the machine as clean as they used to be. ""It's probably because a satisfactory replacement hasn't yet been found,"" he said. ""This is often the case with industry when things happen that aren't necessarily to their advantage."" Excessive phosphorus dumps have become a major problem for Canada's waterways, says Lewis Molot, an environmental scientist at York University. Phosphorus in certain detergents and cleaning products softens water, reduces spotting and rusting , holds dirt, and increases performance. But it is also a plant fertilizer, Prof. Molot says, meaning when it enters a lake, it causes massive amounts of algae to grow. […] PROCTER & GAMBLE Co., maker of Cascade-brand detergent, says on its website it has invested heavily in product research and development over the past 1½ years to develop phosphate-free formulas.",positive,2011,1,6
GENERAL ELECTRIC,"Posture on carbon, other environment issues, remains to be seen as Duke, Cinergy progress","Environmental strategy is not among the key matters identified so far by executives of Duke and Cinergy as they propose merging to form one of the country's largest electric utilities, but they will clearly have to reconcile some differences in approach to carbon emissions and other environmental issues. Duke Energy Chairman and CEO Paul Anderson, who would serve as the merged company's chairman, came out in April in favor of an economy-wide carbon tax to control greenhouse gas emissions. But Cinergy CEO James Rogers, who is to be the new company's president and CEO, continues to prefer a cap on CO2 and an emissions trading program to help utilities meet the restrictions, although Cinergy has not endorsed any specific plan, a company spokesman said last week. […] ""I thought it would be important for our company to partner with a company that has experience in nuclear power plants,"" Rogers said. For the future, he said, ""I believe nuclear will play a role, along with renewables, coal and gas.""  Cinergy's subsidiary Cincinnati Gas & Electric tried to build a nuclear unit but abandoned the effort in the early 1980s after construction problems led to delays in regulatory approvals. Rogers said the merger would not change Cinergy's plans to develop a low-emitting integrated coal gasification combined-cycle plant, although Cinergy must reach a final agreement with GENERAL ELECTRIC and Bechtel and get the necessary regulatory approvals. IGCC technology ""gives us the ability to modernize our fleet and reduce the emissions from generation in the Midwest, and that's an important part of our objective going forward,"" he said.

Closer to home, competition has emerged between airlines pursuing alternative fuel solutions, although it appears to be a David and Goliath contest. On Monday, Sir Richard Branson told a conference in Boston that ""early next year"" Virgin Atlantic would be conducting a Boeing 747 test flight with one of the renewable fuels his Virgin Group had developed. Noting Air New Zealand's plans for a similar 747 test flight late next year, a Reuters report said ""Virgin is trying to beat that airline by testing biofuels first"".  The Air NZ initiative was announced on September 28, when the airline signed a memorandum of understanding with its biofuel test partners, Boeing and Rolls-Royce. Virgin's similar agreement is with Boeing and the other major engine manufacturer, GENERAL ELECTRIC.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Pressure cooker INTRODUCTION:,"Airlines are turning up the heat on engine makers to develop new, more efficient powerplants to drive the development of the next generation of narrowbody aircraft Open rotor engines look futuristic, and even slightly improbable, but there is a very real possibility that aircraft powered by this radical technology could be replacing Airbus A320s and Boeing 737s as the industry's narrowbody workhorses in the coming 10-15 years. ""It may well be that somebody, while flight testing prototypes, comes up with a reason why open rotor technology can't work, but starting here and working forwards, it really should be plan A,"" says Hal Calamvokis, ?strategic planning manager at UK-based ?low-cost carrier easyJet.  As the picture to the right shows, open rotors basically look like fancy propellor-type engines. There are, however, design challenges. For instance, the classic ?underwing mounting position of today's turbofans may not be possible with the large-diameter blades of the open rotor. This points towards mounting the engines on the sides of the aft fuselage or ?beneath a high wing. If the potential can be realised, however, the introduction of open rotor engines would usher in the first all-new propulsion architecture since the late-1960s, when GE's introduction of the CF6 turbofan offered a game-changing improvement in fuel efficiency over turbojets. The issue of new engine technology has come to prominence as several major European and US airlines step up the pressure on airframers to commit to next generation ?narrowbodies to facilitate their domestic fleet replacement and growth. The ideal successor, they say, would provide a quantum leap in economics improvement and emissions reduction as fuel costs continue to slice deep into their bottom lines and regulatory bodies demand greater cuts in ?carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions.

Over 50 per cent of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) surveyed in Latin America and 45 per cent in Africa see declines in biodiversity as a challenge to business growth. In contrast, less than 20 per cent of their counterparts in Western Europe share such concerns. […] ""Better accounting of business impacts on biodiversity - both positive and negative - is essential to spur change in business investment and operations,"" says Joshua Bishop, the TEEB for Business report coordinator and Chief Economist of IUCN. ""Smart business leaders realise that integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services in their value chains can generate substantial cost savings and new revenues, as well as improved business reputation and license to operate."" The TEEB report cites the case of the multinational mining giant Rio Tinto as one company that has committed itself to achieving Net Positive Impact on biodiversity. In association with leading conservation experts the company has developed new ways of assessing the biodiversity values of its land holdings, and has begun to apply biodiversity compensation or 'offset' methodologies in Madagascar, Australia and North America.

INTERNATIONAL BUS.MCHS.,A stunning climb up the green ladder; Personal computers,"Apple, Hewlett-Packard et al take note: in just one year the Chinese computer manufacturer Lenovo rose from bottom rung on the Greenpeace ladder, which ranks technology companies' environmental friendliness, to the top. The company, which has its headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, took over IBM's personal computer division in 2005. It earned praise for its precautionary principle stance - taking responsibility for advocating action such as chemical use even where the scientific evidence of harm is not clear. Lenovo was also lauded for its stance on individual producer responsibility, looking after products at the end of their lives wherever recycling legislation was being considered. Lenovo's director of environmental affairs, Mike Pierce, says the company was at the bottom of the Greenpeace survey of 14 technology companies last year because it had failed to communicate its environmental policies.[…] For 38 years Pierce worked for IBM, in product development, manufacturing and marketing, rising to business unit general manager. He moved to the personal computer division a couple of years before Lenovo took over IBM's personal computer assets in May 2005, when it had become ""increasingly clear"" personal computers had unique environmental issues such as recycling that needed attention. Pierce provides a global environmental perspective for Lenovo, whose shipping outside China began in earnest just over two years ago. Last December Lenovo began offering a free take-back recycling service within China to business and consumers of Lenovo and IBM computers. In Australia a take-back recycling program is offered to Lenovo's commercial customers as part of a bundled sale deal, which might include credit against a new purchase. Given the company's tiny share of the home consumer market, Pierce says, the recycling scheme offered to Australian consumers is more ""ad hoc"", but Lenovo will take its branded products back for free from individuals. The fate of old IBM-branded computers in Australia is left with IBM.[…]",positive,2007,12,19

GENERAL ELECTRIC,GE tilts at green power protectionism," Like Kermit the frog, GENERAL ELECTRIC vice-chairman John Krenicki occasionally laments that it's not easy being green. Mr. Krenicki runs GE's massive energy division - its 85,000 employees posted $37-billion in sales last year - and on the face of it, everything's going his way. Anyone getting into wind power will likely order GE turbines. The same is true on solar, hydro, grids and just about any other technology that keeps the lights on. As a dominant player in green power, Mr. Krenicki would seem to have the world at his feet.  But here's where Kermit's problem comes in to play: It's not easy being green because sustainable power has become such a hot button issues for politicians. No self-respecting leader has a power policy that doesn't include voter-friendly planks, such as local jobs in green manufacturing, or local content in green power projects. Political overlays tend to add inefficiencies to power, and the process-driven GE types just hate inefficiency. […] So on the eve of the G8 and G20 summits last week, Mr. Krenicki did a Canadian tour, to preach the gospel of eliminating trade barriers on green power. (An engineer by training, he recent made the same pilgrimage on the other side of the Atlantic, helping set continental energy policy within the European Union, in part by pitching at the World Economic Forum.)  The core of GE's message is that the power industry rewards scale: Large, integrated markets will get cheaper green power than small, fragmented markets. Policies that put local interests, such as green jobs, ahead of this over-arching goal are bad policy.  In making this case, GE is clearly talking its own book. But consider what Mr. Krenicki is arguing; there's a Buy America policy in Washington in the wake of the recession. A GE executive who should be wrapping himself in the Stars & Stripes hates that nationalist concept. He sees an America-first policy hurting GE in most of the countries it serves, including China, India and Canada. […]",positive,2010,6,29

WELLS FARGO & CO,Getting gold out of green; Companies learn eco-friendliness helps bottom line,"In the 1990s, corporate America's embrace of the green movement was led mostly by free-spirited, maverick companies such as Ben & Jerry's, Starbucks and Whole Foods. Now, mainstream giants in markets spanning consumer products, banking, airlines and chemicals have sweeping programs to shrink their companies' impact on the environment -- and cash in on consumers' desire to go green. Many see doing so as a virtual necessity as regulators consider limits on greenhouse gas emissions and consumers demand environmentally friendly products. […] Wells Fargo was named the Environmental Protection Agency's No.1 green power partner this year after it offset 40% of its electricity use by buying renewable energy credits, which are certificates that subsidize the cost of wind, biomass or other alternative energy projects. The banking giant also has provided $750 million in loans for the construction of environmentally friendly office and apartment buildings.

GOOGLE,The New Greens Like It Big; The green view based on small sources and market power will give way to one based on scale and subsidies.,"The winds of economic destruction are flattening not just retirement accounts but also naive visions for a green economy. Public support for costly new green mandates is weakening, and government budgets to fund them are bleeding red ink. Plummeting prices of oil and other fossil fuels have made it harder for green to compete in the marketplace. IPOs of firms working on ""clean tech"" green energy that have fueled fantasies of the coming energy revolution have crashed to a halt. In all the bad economic news, a new face of green is coming into focus. Whereas the old view of green tech was based on many small, decentralized sources of power and a green economy that harnessed the power of the marketplace, the new version will rely more heavily on regulation and subsidies. It will also embrace the wisdom, true in most of the energy business, that bigger is better for weathering economic storms. The market, it's now clear, is not a reliable force for driving the adoption of green technologies. Just as the role of government is rising across banking and other sectors of the economy, new green will be much more wary of market forces as the route to profit. Google dreamed, in its ""RE < C"" scheme, that if it put enough money into green renewable energy (""RE"") that eventually those power sources would triumph over dirty coal. With coal prices half what they were in 7 and the cost of steel and concrete for building coal-fired power plants sinking, that strategy isn't looking like a winner. Supporters of renewable energy have been much more effective in affecting regulation: in most of the United States it is now nearly impossible to get approval to build new coal plants (even when they replace older, less efficient units) and half the states force power companies to buy rising amounts of renewable electricity almost regardless of cost. Obama plans to extend such mandates nationwide. […]",positive,2008,12,8

The question may not be where will the work be done - at home, with the customer, on the road or in the office - but how and for whom it is done.[…] According to Mr Noel Treacy, Minister of State for Science, Technology and Commerce, the main driving forces behind the rise of teleworking in the US and Britain have been the problems caused by commuting to city centre offices, including stress on workers, environmental pollution and energy and property costs. These influences have a familiar ring about them.[…] But again the research results are positive, with a study at the University of Massachusetts discovering that teleworkers or telecommuters were: as productive as, or more productive than, their non-telecommuting work colleagues, happier, more dedicated employees, better able to balance the pressures of their work and family lives, contributing to reduced overhead expenses and air pollution, traffic congestion and fuel consumption and; improving employee attraction and retention statistics.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,"Developers delay $4-billion Bute hydro project; Amid confusion over B.C. energy policy, Plutonic Power and GE decides to wait a year to pursue green power deal"," Plutonic Power Corp. and GENERAL ELECTRIC Co. will delay their controversial, $4-billion Bute hydroelectric project north of Vancouver, a decision made amid the public-policy confusion that has beset energy development in British Columbia. While Vancouver-based Plutonic insists it could have won a power-purchase agreement from BC Hydro, it has instead decided to spend another year collecting data and conducting other preparatory work, hoping to move to officially win a contract with the provincially owned electricity provider at a later date. With the delay, the earliest Bute could be supplying power is 2014.  Bute was among dozens of projects being considered in a call for green power issued by BC Hydro nearly two years ago. The process descended into chaos last summer when the independent B.C. Utilities Commission rejected BC Hydro's plans as ""not in the public interest."" The commission also said that hydro could rely more heavily on the half-century-old greenhouse-gas-spewing natural gas power plant Burrard Thermal in Port Moody.  The situation flared as competing jurisdictions around the world - in Canada, B.C.'s chief rival is Ontario - pushed aggressively to attract green energy capital from investors still scarred by the near-implosion of the global economy. Winners in the B.C. clean call are expected to be announced by BC Hydro by the end of this week - Plutonic and GE are still in the running with a small project called Upper Toba near Bute - but the whole drama has led to a rewriting of energy development law in B.C., with Premier Gordon Campbell's Liberal government ready to introduce the Clean Energy Act.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,"Mexico to build six to eight nuclear units, says utility official","Mexican energy authorities plan to build six to eight 1,400-MW nuclear units, Rafael Fernandez, director of Laguna Verde, which is the country's only nuclear plant, said this week. While no formal plan has been announced, officials from the energy ministry and the Federal Electricity Commission, or CFE, are working on the plan for a nuclear expansion, Fernandez said during a November 8 presentation at Platts Mexican Energy conference in Mexico City. The first two planned units would be built at the Laguna Verde plant in the southern Gulf state of Veracruz, Fernandez said. When the units begin operating, expected by 2024, they will account for more than one-third of Mexico's non-carbon-emitting generating capacity, he said. Fernandez said when environmental costs are included, nuclear is less expensive than combined-cycle natural gas-fired plants that have dominated Mexico's generating capacity in recent years. Unlike the combined-cycle plants, which are built by independent power producers that sell power to CFE under long-term contracts, only the CFE is allowed by law to own and operate nuclear plants. Laguna Verde was built by GENERAL ELECTRIC and has two 682.5-MW units. The second unit was completed in 1995. GE designed a 20% uprate for each unit. Iberdrola and Alstom are implementing the uprate under a $600 million contract.

WAL MART STORES,Economic blues leave no room for green; CMO study finds focus on environmentalism waning in tough times,"The green-marketing movement is taking a hit from the economy. According to a new study by Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, chief marketing officers distracted by the downturn are placing less emphasis on cause-related and environmental issues. In fact, marketing that is ``beneficial for society'' or that minimizes the impact on the environment ranked at the bottom of five priorities listed by respondents for the next 12 months. The shift seemed to reflect changing priorities on the part of their customers. ``If [consumers] can't afford the product, or it's not the quality you want, [they're] not going to be focusing on its environmental friendliness,'' said Christine Moorman, the professor who led the project surveying top marketers at 72 companies culled from both the Fortune 1000 and Forbes' 200 top small firms. […] For example, Wal-Mart Stores, which made sustainability a central feature of its communications strategy in recent years, is talking about it less often lately. An analysis of news stories on LexisNexis shows an average of 73 stories monthly featuring Wal-Mart and ``sustainability'' in the past year but only 37 in the past month. Environmental or sustainability themes had found their way into only 12 Wal-Mart press releases through Sept. 11 of this year (and none since 6), compared with 29 during the same period last year. And when Wal-Mart launched a new campaign targeting opinion leaders around the political conventions last month, the message was about how the company is stimulating the economy by saving people money, with none of the sustainability themes that have been common in such ads in years past. Wal-Mart executives haven't lost all their interest in sustainability, said one supplier rep, ``but I'm not hearing about it nearly as often.'' WPP Group's digital and relationship-marketing shop Bridge Worldwide, Cincinnati, which has made ``marketing with meaning'' its mantra in recent years, isn't seeing clients or prospects back off from marketing that adds value to people's lives just yet. ``But logically, I can see how that would be a gut reaction,'' said Chief Marketing Strategist Bob Gilbreath. ``If you lose your job, you're not volunteering for things.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,'Wet steam' recycling is hot property,"A SCOTTISH company is attempting to corner a new £2billion ((EURO)2.5 billion) market for turning waste heat into electricity. Heliex Power, based in East Kilbride, near Glasgow, has developed a way of capturing low-temperature steam that is usually discharged by factories and turning it into power. The potential for Heliex's technology has attracted interest from investors including BP's Ventures arm, which backs clean technology innovations. The oil giant first invested in Heliex in December 2010 and stumped up more cash in the firm's latest £5m fundraising.  […] The company plans to either float or sell the business within five years. When the time comes, Wright thinks there will be no shortage of offers. The waste heat recovery market has attracted some big guns of the industry in recent years. GENERAL ELECTRIC, the American industrial conglomerate, snapped up the waste heat power generation business of Florida-based Calnetix in October 2010. For now, the fresh injection of cash will enable Heliex to buy a factory and to start manufacturing. It expects to start shipping generators to customers by the end of the year. These devices will be capable of producing 100 to 150 kilowatts of power, and Heliex has plans to scale up the generators to 1 megawatt for larger industrial sites.",positive,2012,6,17
CHEVRON,Top 10 Trends of 2007,"NEW YORK. It's a small world after all. Private and public lives are merging on the Internet, corporate giants are embracing environmental initiatives, industry competitors are collaborating, and the transfer of wealth from the developed world to emerging economies is picking up speed at a mind-boggling pace. […] GREEN CAPITALISM. Call it corporate social responsibility or cold, hard capitalism, but marketing a brand or corporation around the environment stepped out of the fringes and squarely into the mainstream, seven years after British Petroleum repositioned itself as ""beyond petroleum."" Yes, scoring points with environmentalists is important to retailers like Wal-Mart and oil companies like CHEVRON, but the bottom line is there's money to be made in less bulky packaging and renewable energy exploration. Indeed, corporate social responsibility is an issue that ""no chairman or CEO will duck"" -- as WPP Group CEO Martin Sorrell told industry analysts this month -- because ""it's a major area of potential revenue generation and profitability."" Hence, Toyota advertises its ""zero emissions vision"" and goal of ""zero waste in all our plants,"" ExxonMobil touts technology designed to improve the performance of batteries used in hybrid cars, and utility holding company Exelon Corp. says, ""A low-carbon energy future is possible, and national climate change legislation is a critical step."" Even Al Gore has switched from being a presidential candidate to an environmental advocate, a Nobel laureate, an advisor at Google and a venture capitalist. And unlike oil companies whose new stance appears hypocritical or at least a stretch based on past actions (Exxon Valdez, anyone?), Gore's transformation at least jibes with his days as a tree hugger.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Force of Nature; Environmentalism is no longer the province of the left. Conservative politicians and big business have both jumped on the bandwagon.,"It seems like a hippie entrepreneur's dream come true: an ecostore with cash registers powered by rooftop wind turbines, skylights instead of light bulbs and photovoltaic solar cells on the roof to help power the bakery's oven. It's so environmentally friendly that even the toilet water is collected from raindrops outside. Only this is not some pipe dream of a fringe activist. The vision comes from Tesco, the world's third largest retailer. Tesco is pumping Â£100 million into environmental technologies to reduce the amount of energy they use by 50 percent, compared with 2000 levels, by 2010. In addition to building 80 new ecostores across Britain over the next year--the greenest of which will be constructed of recycled materials and will burn food waste for electricity--they're also making small changes that could have big effects. They're paying customers not to use plastic bags, which they expect will cut consumption by 25 percent in two years. Tesco is not the only commercial firm that has taken an interest in saving the planet, and making a killing besides. Renewable Energy Corp., a Norwegian solar-energy company, had the world's largest-ever renewable energy IPO in May. It was 15 times oversubscribed and raised more than $1 billion, valuing REC at nearly $7 billion. You wouldn't mistake REC's CEO Erik Thorsen for a New Age Joni Mitchell. ""I don't have anything against helping the environment,"" says Thorsen. ""But the main driver for us is profit."" Something weird is happening in the once marginal world of environmentalism. The green cause is no longer the preserve of woolly-minded liberals and fringe activists. Its tenets are being actively pursued by business leaders, stockholders and investment managers. In the popular mind-set, natural disasters such as New Orleans's Hurricane Katrina, floods in Eastern Europe and swirling desert sands in Beijing are now linked to a change in climate that threatens our way of life and our grandchildrens' future. Europe's second record-breaking heat wave in three years--with the hottest 7 in U.K. history and more than 40 dead in France and Spain--has only cemented this relationship. Environmental concerns have grown so widespread that no politician can ignore them. […] The most startling turnaround, however, is among business leaders. Corporations are giving themselves green makeovers to improve efficiency, save money and look more attractive to investors and the public. According to a recent report from the Climate Group, an international environmental charity, 43 multinationals--including Bayer, BT and DuPont--saved a combined $11.6 billion last year by improving energy efficiency, reducing waste output and harnessing solar power. GENERAL ELECTRIC's Ecoimagination campaign to cut carbon emissions, partly by selling low-emissions products ranging from power plants to fluorescent light bulbs, raked in $10.1 billion last year, up from $6.2 billion in 2004.

I hope they stay here in the forefront of the U.S. consciousness, but they may not. Something could relegate those issues to the margins tomorrow. Since 9/11, the situation has been fairly simple and straightforward: issues of terrorism and security have seized the public imagination to the extent that everything else has become a lesser priority. Anything that has a longer time horizon, like climate change, with a slower fuse to anticipate catastrophe, has to wait. […] Vice President for Sustainability, Wal-Mart New stores will use less energy Hurricane Katrina was a big turning point for us. It showed us that we've got a role we can play that might be greater than we realized. Two years later, we have prototype stores--the first is in Kansas City, Mo. It uses LED lighting in the freezers, and a heating and cooling system without a fan. That store uses 20 percent less energy than a store we'd have opened in 2005. One product we're promoting heavily are compact fluorescent light bulbs, or CFLs. They account for only 5 percent of light-bulb sales, but at Wal-Mart we've been redoing our aisles to make CFLs more visible. Today 20 or 30 percent of the light-bulb aisles will be CFLs, mostly at eye level. We have a goal of selling 100 million CFLs in 2007, more than double what we did last year. That will save our customers $3 billion on electricity. It will save 700 million incandescent bulbs that will never have to be produced.

Architects vie to create the most sustainable skyscrapers. The current champion in Manhattan appears to be Norman Foster's futuristic headquarters for the Hearst Corp., lit to its innermost depths by God's own high-efficiency light source, the sun. The building's ""destination dispatch"" elevators require passengers to enter their floor at a kiosk, where a screen directs them to a cab, grouping them to wring the last watt of efficiency from their 30-second trips. But it is expected to be challenged soon in Manhattan by a new BANK OF AMERICA tower, designed by Cook & Fox, which takes ""sustainability"" to a point just short of growing its own food. Every drop of rain that falls on its roof will be captured for use; scraps from the cafeteria will be fermented in the building to produce methane as a supplementary fuel for a generator intended to produce more than half the building's electricity; the waste heat from the generator will both warm the offices and power a refrigeration plant to cool them.

With pen and paper in hand, Vikki and Ashley feverishly hurry off to find the  next creature on their list:  an East African crowned crane.  Vikki and Ashley weren't exploring the jungles of Africa. There weren't any  lions, tigers or bears to be seen on this trip. Still, they were on a safari  of sorts. The two youngsters from the World of Knowledge Montessori School were  spending their last day of summer school visiting Discovery Island, an  11.5-acre zoo at Walt Disney World. They located 11 species on an unusual scavenger hunt that took them along  bamboo and palm tree-bordered pathways in the junglelike setting. Among their  collection were a few rare feathered friends such as the eclectus parrot from  New Guinea, a scarlet ibis from South America and the kookaburra, a large  kingfisher that makes its home in the grasslands of Australia. Its most  distinctive feature is a hideous laughing call familiar to those who might  have seen an old Tarzan movie or two. The island visit was the culmination of a summer educational camp program  that in addition to math, language and reading focused on the study of  wetlands and endangered species, said Gail Gilmore, owner of World of  Knowledge and teacher of upper elementary pupils there. While math and reading  clinics help pupils retain skills they might lose during the summer - they  typically lose 60 percent of their reading ability, Gilmore says - this type  of hands-on encounter also has a lasting impact. […] The island zoo is home to 120 species of birds, primates and reptiles, some  of them on the endangered species list. The accredited zoo participates with  parks from different areas in the ""species survival plan."" Various species  are bred at the zoo and their offspring are returned to the wild.

GOOGLE,Climate change to be visible by ZIP code; Online tool will show how sea levels are expected to rise,"With the click of a computer mouse, the risks of rising sea levels will soon be searchable -- by ZIP code -- for all U.S. coastal communities. An online mapping tool will show how much sea levels are expected to rise in each area, as well as the number of residents and buildings that could be flooded. Initially launched in March 2012 for New York, New Jersey and Florida, it will expand to cover New England on Wednesday, the Pacific states later this spring and the rest of the coastal U.S. by the end of summer. ""This is a brave new world. Rising seas are posing a totally new challenge to American ingenuity,"" says Ben Strauss, vice president for climate impacts at Climate Central, a non-profit group based in Princeton, N.J. It used private foundation funding to create the Surging Seas database. The results, based on data from more than 10 federal agencies, tell a sobering story.  In New York City,  different projections suggest the sea level will rise nearly a foot by 2040. But with future storms,  there's more than a one in three chance for a 6-foot flood by that year, Strauss says. That would be more than a foot higher than anything on record except Superstorm Sandy, which caused widespread devastation  in Manhattan and parts of New Jersey in October 2012. It also would  be  enough to threaten the subway system again, Strauss says. With  Earth Day arriving  Tuesday, Surging Seas is part of a new generation of free  tools, made possible by  improvements in computing  and data availability, that show how local climates are changing as global temperatures rise. Another, launched in February, lets  people  see deforestation, which exacerbates global warming, in real time. ""It's groundbreaking,"" says Crystal Davis of World Resources Institute, a non-profit  in Washington, D.C. It spent more than two years working with Google and more than 40  partners to build Global Forest Watch.

It also has access to plentiful, cheap, clean and renewable hydroelectric power - all key to the sprawling warehouses, which contain thousands and even hundreds of thousands of computers to feed the Internet age's voracious appetite for data processing and networking storage.

There is Deep Thunder, its high-performance computer-driven weather forecasting system. IBM is also providing the software to link and analyse data collected from sensors installed at dykes, pipes and roads. Armed with this intelligence, the water bureaucrats will have a much clearer picture of what is happening as well as what is likely to happen.

Frost & Sullivan, on the other hand, expects US$1.565 trillion in business opportunities across various industries related to this area by 2020. IBMâ  s pitch to city mayors around the world is that their municipalities are â  reaching their limitsâ  and that the time has come for them to be smarter about using their infrastructure and resources. It provides the statistics to make its case. For example, commercial and residential buildings consume one-third of the worldâ  s energy; half the worldâ  s water supply to cities is wasted because of leaking infrastructure; more than a billion cars are on the roads today and this number will double by 2020.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Corporations joining in global climate change game,"UNLIKE the US administration, corporate America is not belittling the science behind the climate change. They are stepping forward to break the current policy-making impasse on global climate in the United States. Corporations perceive the shift in consumer attitude as awareness grows about climate changes. Companies, operating on a global scale, are beginning to see the costs and the benefits of the climate game. Opportunities for new products and technology that mitigate the effects of climate change are compelling. But they see a potential threat of rising costs and the long-term sustainability of companies. Some are concerned about reputational damage.  Struggling General Motors for a long time pooh-poohed alternative fuel technology for cars and has paid a price. Its market capitalisation has fallen by half. It recognises the risk in being at the centre of the environmental debate. Big bet […] Going green Other corporate giants are going green as well. GENERAL ELECTRIC, the world's largest conglomerate, is doubling its research and development spending on clean energy to US$1.5 billion. 'I think (global warming) is something we need to start figuring out and taking proactive steps to make improvements on,' GE chairman and chief executive Jeffrey Immelt said recently. GE's 'ecomagination' initiative calls for increased spending to develop new technologies such as wind power generation, diesel-electric hybrid locomotives, more efficient aircraft engines and appliances, and advanced water treatment systems. When a company of the size of GE takes such a public position, it obviously pleases environmental advocates. Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center for Climate Change, called it an act of courage 'to say they want to be part of the policy dialogue, which is very difficult in the United States at this moment'.

INTERNATIONAL BUS.MCHS.,Emissions Regulation: A New Era Dawns,"[…] The EPA is hoping that the threat of appearing as one of the top U.S. industrial sources of greenhouse gases will spur companies to voluntarily slash their emissions. According to the EPA's top air official, Gina McCarthy, the emissions registry could have an impact similar to that of the Toxics Release Inventory, which since its inception in 1987 has been credited with spurring substantial reductions in toxic emissions. Emissions registry has been anticipated for some time, and some of the largest emitters in the United States have been tracking their energy usage for years, including such corporations as Hewlett-Packard, Boeing and Duke Energy. IBM has emissions data dating back to 1990 and has been publishing reports on it for the last 15 years with the Energy Department.[…] That begins, says Neil Hawkins, vice president of sustainability for Dow Chemical, by being aware of the subtle shifts in public policy. ""The bottom line is you better start anticipating regulations before they ever become final,"" Hawkins says. ""You want to be assessing and planning and you want to hit the ground running with a program and management approach, especially if it's a large-scale regulation that's going to affect your whole enterprise."" That management approach should hit on two fronts, says Wayne Balta, IBM's vice president of corporate environmental affairs: marrying a company's operations and business interests with a lower environmental footprint; and taking a leadership position on the issue, which allows the company to be at the forefront in policy. ""A company's environmental policy is a long-term subject and it requires a long-term focus,"" says Balta. ""It's not a bandwagon that you just jump on and off, based on public opinion.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,"Finance anaylsts confident long-term outlook for clean energy is solid, despite Solyndra","While the political fallout from the Solyndra collapse may chill federal support for clean energy projects in the short-term, finance experts and analysts say the long-term outlook for the industry remains solid, particularly as states implement their renewable portfolio standards. California solar-panel maker Solyndra last month filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and laid off 1,100 workers, despite receiving a $535 million taxpayer-backed loan guarantee from DOE in 2009. The administration had repeatedly touted the company as a green-tech leader, with President Barack Obama personally touring its new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility -- built with the help of the loan guarantee -- in May 2010. […] Alam said ""tried and true"" renewable technologies, such as wind, solar photovoltaics and geothermal, should have few issues in finding financing through banks or the institutional market, which includes insurance companies and pension funds. Newer technologies, such as solar thermal, will be judged by financers on a case-by-case basis, he said. In fact, a report from analysts at Bloomberg New Energy Finance last week found a ""surge"" in global investment in renewables in the third quarter, even as Europe faced an economic crisis. ""The industry has swung between being a buyer's market and a seller's market a few times in recent years: right now, you would love to be a developer with access to funding, but not a supplier,"" said Michael Liebreich, chief executive of Bloomberg New Energy Finance. ""Eventually things will come back into balance. Of course the furor in the US over the failure of Solyndra hasn't helped clean energy share prices."" In addition, GENERAL ELECTRIC last week announced plans to build what it calls the largest solar manufacturing facility in the US. The factory, to be built in Aurora, Colorado, is expected to begin shipping solar panels in 2013 and will produce enough panels annually to power 80,000 homes, the company said. Though the 1705 loan guarantee program expired on September 30, DOE does have another loan guarantee program, the 1703, that it can use to finance some clean-energy projects. DOE received some funding in the fiscal 2011 budget to support the credit subsidy fees for about $1.2 billion in 1703 program clean-energy loan guarantees, though that amount is a far cry from the approximately $15 billion in stimulus-funded 1705 loan guarantees that DOE was able to offer.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Boeing sees gains in the Dreamliner,"BOEING's new 787 Dreamliner will be safer for passengers and better for the environment, the aircraft manufacturer's environmental expert Jeff Hawk says. The 787-8 ushers in a new way of building big planes -- it is largely made from composite materials and will be the first airliner with a carbon fibre fuselage instead of aluminium. The airliner is also the first to be designed from scratch since the hugely successful Boeing 777 in the early 1990s.  An all-new design has allowed Boeing's engineers to optimise the advantages of new materials, engines, systems and design to create a more efficient aircraft than would have been possible by updating an existing design with only some of those advances, Mr Hawk says. As a result, according to Boeing, the 787 will, for its size, be environmentally friendlier than any other airliner flying today on three fronts; fuel, emissions and noise. Most of those benefits flow directly from the use of composite materials which are 15 per cent to 20 per cent lighter than metals and make up nearly half of the total aircraft. Less weight equals the need for less powerful engines, which in turn weigh a little less, so the structure they are bolted to doesn't need to be quite as beefy, Mr Hawk says. ""That is an example of integration, when you combine related functions to have an optimum design."" The aircraft will burn 20 per cent less fuel than the Boeing 767 it replaces and the 777, Mr Hawkins says. For airlines struggling under the weight of record oil prices, that is money in the bank. The engines made by Rolls Royce or GENERAL ELECTRIC will also reduce emissions by about the same amount, while powering the jet to the same speed as existing airliners -- about 85 per cent of the speed of sound.

The plastic pollution is washed down the drain, evades filters in wastewater treatment plants and flows into waterways, warned New York Attorney-General Eric Schneiderman recently. […] Groups like the International Coastal Cleanup Singapore have worked for decades to scrub coastlines of plastic waste that breaks down into these minuscule fragments. But there is only so much a clean-up crew can do.  The best way to tackle the problem is at its source, which is why environmental groups like 5 Gyres in the US have pushed legislators and consumer companies to get rid of the microbeads for good.

In practice, however, that will come to mean rather more than merely smaller packaging. In some companies, green considerations are forcing innovations in far more profound areas. A new focus for INTEL began in 2006 when it examined the potential carbon output of its processors if it continued on the same lines; the resulting figures persuaded the company to look at a different way of designing its chips. As more firms see that there are economic benefits to going green, we'll see more products that reflect their shifted focus.

The Internet search company, which consumes vast amounts of electricity to run the computers in its data centers, created a subsidiary last month called Google Energy. It then applied for approval from the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be allowed to buy and sell power much like utilities do. Google said that it did not have specific plans to become an energy trader and that its primary goal was to gain flexibility for buying more renewable energy for its power-hungry data centers.

Jeff Immelt, chair and chief executive officer of GE, told executives at a Canadian Club event in Toronto yesterday that the economy has been changed forever by the events of the past 18 months. ""If you think this is only a cycle you're just wrong. This is a permanent reset,"" he said. ""There are going to be elements of the economy that will never be the same, ever."" […] ""The government always wins in these battles. The only dimension is time."" The longer-term prospects are also encouraging, he said, citing globalization and growth in emerging markets as an ""unyielding force."" There might be job losses and slower growth in China and India, ""but if you're the governments of those two countries you cannot go backwards; it is not an option."" Immelt said he's ""long on oil,"" based on the certainty China and India will continue to push hundreds of millions of their citizens into the middle class - meaning more cars on the road and high demand for fuel-consuming products. The North American companies best positioned to tap that growth will be the ones that double-down on investments in innovation and technology during the downturn. ""If you keep investing in technology and innovation in the worst of times, your competitive advantage grows,"" he said. Immelt is betting that GE's strength in energy, infrastructure and health care will give it an advantage as government stimulus packages around the world take effect. The company makes everything from jet engines and locomotives to power plant equipment and water treatment systems. In recent years, through its Ecomagination program, GE has focused on developing more sustainable products that use less energy and produce less pollution and waste. It's why Immelt is a big proponent of Obama's emphasis on energy efficiency, renewable power, green infrastructure, and smart-grid technologies. He also supports the swift creation of a national carbon cap-and-trade program that would encourage the adoption of the kind of low-carbon technologies GE is making. The need to re-energize innovation and manufacturing in the U.S. has never been greater, Immelt said yesterday, but the country must not fall into protectionist mode. ""Buy American just doesn't work,"" he said, citing the fact GE gets $7 billion of its revenue through Canadian operations that employ 9,000 people.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,"No Joke, Bulb Change Is Challenge for U.S.","The new energy bill signed this week makes it official. When 2012 hits, stores can no longer sell the cheap but inefficient incandescent light bulbs that are fixtures in most homes.  Even so, light  bulb manufacturers say that worries about greenhouse gases and the high cost of energy had them moving away from conventional incandescents way before Congress weighed in.   For quite some time, they note, they have been trying to soften the light emitted by compact fluorescent lights, bring down the cost of light-emitting diodes -- and yes, find ways to increase the efficiency of incandescents. Many of the products are already on the market, and more will be available before the deadline kicks in,  ''Sure, you'll see more compact fluorescents five years from now, but you would have seen them without any energy bill,'' said the chief executive of Osram Sylvania,  Charlie Jerabek.  Michael B. Petras Jr., vice president of GE Consumer and Industrial -- the unit that includes GENERAL ELECTRIC's lighting business -- broadened the thought to all forms of lighting. ''You'll see different light sources for your decorative chandelier, for your recessed lighting and for your under-cabinet lights,'' he said. ''And I can assure you that all the kinds of light sources are already getting a lot more efficient.'' Including incandescents. Congress has not specifically outlawed incandescent bulbs, only inefficient ones. In February, G.E. said that it was developing a high-efficiency incandescent that will radiate more than twice the light of conventional incandescents. It expects to make that one commercially available by 2010, and one that is twice as efficient a few years later. […] Manufacturers are putting a lot of stock in light-emitting diodes -- or L.E.D.'s. They operate with chips made of nontoxic materials and last for about 50,000 hours, compared with 1,000 hours for an incandescent and 6,000 for a compact fluorescent. A tiny L.E.D. can shed as much light as a cumbersome bulb, which makes them easier to integrate into a home's decor. And, they are extremely energy efficient. […]",positive,2007,12,22

GENERAL ELECTRIC,"The Zero Effect; THE FUTURE OF SUSTAINABLE DESIGN INCREASINGLY MEANS ELIMINATING CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS, THE MOST PREVALENT GREENHOUSE GAS. BUT WHAT DOES THAT DO TO ARCHITECTURE?","Today you've exhaled, on average, 2.2 pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2), the greenhouse gas poster child for our current fascination with global warming. Just by breathing, you've entered a cycle of carbon emission and sequestration, an environmental chess game with consequences that are well documented, if little understood. Americans will emit roughly 44,000 pounds of CO2 per capita this year, an amount over three times the per capita average for the world. And if you're thinking of planting a forest to offset your last trip to Las Vegas, keep in mind the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates a healthy tree can consume roughly 13 pounds of CO2 in a year. Truth be told, human breathing contributes nothing to global warming. We each eat plenty of plants, which act as carbon sinks since they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and thus by eating we remove a great deal of carbon dioxide from the environment on a daily basis. If anything, we can breath easier knowing respiration qualifies as a carbon-neutral activity. Such calculated explanations underscore the complications of accounting for carbon emissions across the broad spectrum of our lives--the food we eat, the places we go, the energy we consume, and increasingly, the buildings and cities we create. […] Although accounting for embodied energy in our buildings represents a challenge (see the related story at the top of page 170), raising awareness of architecture's effects on carbon emissions has reached a fever pitch. The U.S. Green Building Council announced in November that it would require all buildings going for commercial certification to achieve a 50 percent CO2 reduction over current levels [record, 1 2007, page 127] through stricter enforcement of the energy and optimization points in the LEED rating system. As exhaustively noted in the February 12 issue of Engineering News-Record, there is no shortage of CO2 emissions news--such as the 1 call from an unlikely industry coalition, including Alcoa, GENERAL ELECTRIC, and Dupont, for instituting national-emissions limits or the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Climate Change 2007 report--helping architects wade through the competing claims, various options, and unwieldy concepts remains a daunting challenge. Mithun's Gregory stresses the combined wisdom of multidisciplinary teams as the short-term solution. On the Lloyd Crossing project, the Mithun team included architects, energy engineers, civil engineers, economists, landscape architects, and even a branding company to help the team communicate its ideas to the community.

BANK OF AMERICA,Green principles a start for banks,"IN 6 2003, 10 leading banks, representing about three quarters of the global project finance market, adopted the Equator Principles, which were developed by several leading banks and are based on the environmental and social policies and safeguards of the International Finance Corporation (IFC).[…] Two years on, and 29 banks, one insurance company and one credit export agency have now adopted the principles. While there still are a few major banks that have chosen to opt out of the principles, it is estimated that participating banks represent 80% of the global project finance market. The question, though, is: have the principles achieved all or any of their stated goals? This is no easy question to answer, particularly as the information required is primarily in the hands of the participating financial institutions, and without either enforcement mechanisms or disclosure requirements in place, what is reported is at the discretion of the lenders. Projects can be independently evaluated and stakeholders surveyed, but there is no overall picture of the success of the principles. Banktrack, a global consortium of global NGOs that monitors banks' investments, has attempted to assess the overall impact. In its first review in 2004 it found that of the then 27 signatories, only two, Citigroup and BANK OF AMERICA, exceeded the standards set out in the principles, having implemented comprehensive and group-wide environmental policies.

The partnership is a response to criticism from environmentalists that airlines are increasing their contribution to climate change at a time when other industries are seeking to cut emissions. Aviation is growing so rapidly that, despite the introduction of new, more efficient aircraft such as the 787, the industry's share of global CO2 production is forecast to rise from 2 to 3 per cent now to 5 to 6 per cent. Virgin, Boeing and GENERAL ELECTRIC, which makes engines, are working to develop a bio-fuel capable of powering an aircraft. They plan to use a Virgin 747 jumbo next year to demonstrate that fuels made from organic matter can power a jet aircraft. Virgin and Boeing are also working on a system of towing aircraft to ""starting grids"" near the head of a runway to cut the amount of time that engines are running on the ground. This system is being tested at Heathrow, Gatwick and San Francisco airports. Sir Richard said yesterday that towing aircraft to the runway would cut CO2 emissions on the ground by 50 per cent.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,New coal plant at centre of global bid,"AN international consortium wants to build a $3 billion-plus ``clean coal'' power plant at Wandoan in Queensland's Surat Basin. It would use technology that converts coal into a cleaner burning fuel and captures and stores carbon dioxide emissions.  The US-based GE Energy, Swiss mining giant Xstrata and the State Government-owned Stanwell Corp are behind the Wandoan project, which could be operational by late 2015. The proposed power plant will use GE's integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) technology, which uses a coal gasification system to convert coal into synthesis gas and produce steam. ``IGCC plants already have demonstrated the capability to significantly reduce emissions, compared to conventional coal-fired plants and gasification technology has been used widely at commercial-scale, to separate carbon,'' GE Energy Power and Water president Steve Bolze said. ``What is really exciting is the opportunity to deploy IGCC technology with CCS (carbon capture and storage) and deliver low carbon coal power in Australia.'' The Wandoan project would produce 400 megawatts of power and capture 90 per cent of the carbon for future storage. A proposal for the plant was submitted to the state and federal governments earlier this year.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,The future looks green for venture capital; Firm makes big bets on clean technologies,"One afternoon last May in Menlo Park, California, a venture capitalist named Ray Lane led me from his office to the parking lot, where an automobile had been delivered a few hours earlier by flatbed truck. The car, built in Norway, was powered by batteries and had a plug-in outlet hidden near the driver-side door. To my eye, the car - branded the Think - resembled a generic European compact, but with some differences; the body, for instance, was made from a textured plastic material. ''You want to drive?'' Lane asked, tossing me the key. Inside, the dashboard was seemingly made of densely woven fabric, and the seat was covered in a material that felt decidedly not like leather. ''The Think is 95 percent recyclable,'' Lane said matter-of-factly. As we drove, Lane told me that if things went well the car would go on sale in the United States in 2009. […] But if technology cannot provide a safety net for green-tech investments, politics just might. At Kleiner, you rarely go a day without hearing how new U.S. laws that put a price on carbon emissions, for example, and that mandate levels of renewable electricity production could speed the adoption of green energy. A price on carbon could, in one quick stroke, make Ausra's carbon-free solar electricity even less expensive than coal- or gas-powered electricity, which would both rise in cost because they produce carbon dioxide; as a result, there would be virtually no limit to the demand for Ausra power. Many of the largest U.S. companies - GENERAL ELECTRIC, General Motors, Dow Chemical, DuPont - now support cap-and-trade laws on carbon. The presidential candidates' energy ideas differ in significant ways, yet Barack Obama and John McCain both back legislation to control carbon emissions. Perhaps the most challenging aspect of Kleiner's endeavor is for green tech to expand into the markets more rapidly than any energy technology has done before. In a conversation I had with Gore in early September, I asked how that would be possible. ''How slowly these technologies have been developed in the past,'' Gore said of green tech, has ''limited bearing on how quickly we could deploy them in the future, if we wanted to.''

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Google aims to reform energy grid; Firm hopes to wean U.S. off use of coal and oil for power,"Google hopes to do for the power grid what it did for the Web. Having conquered the market for Web search by first simplifying how it is done and then making sales of related advertising more efficient, Google is now funding green technology and using its brand power to lobby for policy change. Google introduced a plan Wednesday to wean the United States off the burning of coal and oil for power by 2030 and to cut oil use for cars by 40 percent. Such initiatives could cost trillions of dollars, but Google believes they should ultimately save money. […] Calls for energy efficiency and the development of alternative sources of fuel, once heard chiefly from environmentalists, are now more mainstream after oil reached record levels well above $100 a barrel. Google itself is making improvements on its servers and at its buildings, identifying $5 million in building-efficiency investments that will pay for themselves in two and a half years. New efficiency standards for computers could cut power consumption by the equivalent of 10 to 20 coal-fired plants by 2010, Google said. Google's energy plan calls for stricter building codes, a commitment to wind and solar tax credits that have lapsed and a price to be placed on carbon emissions through a cap-and-trade plan or a tax. Google recently joined with GENERAL ELECTRIC to speed up development of new power grid technology. Echoing calls from the presidential candidates of both major U.S. political parties, Google wants to see more smart meters and real-time pricing to let people see how much energy they use and what it costs. Schmidt, a business adviser to Barack Obama's campaign, was discouraged by talk of ''clean coal'' among Republicans, but he added that he expected changes on energy policy no matter who won the election in November. At the time of Google's initial public offering in 2004, the founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin pledged employee time and about 1 percent of Google's equity - three million shares - plus 1 percent of profits to philanthropy. In 2006, Google converted 300,000 shares into about $90 million to set up Google.org. Schmidt said there was a branding benefit from the effort, but it was ultimately driven by what the two founders wanted, and he doubted investors worried too much about the cost.",positive,2008,10,3
GENERAL ELECTRIC,Exxon gives millions to climate project," Long the oil industry's chief global warming naysayer, the Irving, Tex., company yesterday said it is contributing $100-million (U.S.) to a 10-year global energy and climate research project at Stanford University. The money, part of a $225-million contribution from companies including General Electric Co., E.On AG and SchlumbergerLtd., will allow Stanford scientists to investigate everything from hydrogen power to technologies aimed at reducing carbon-dioxide emissions. Exxon Mobil's move is the latest in a string of environmentally friendly gestures that contrast sharply with its position in years past, when it suggested natural climate change, rather than human activity, was causing the Earth to warm. It also comes as the petroleum giant, the world's largest publicly held oil concern, is coming under fire from shareholders on its global warming position and is the subject of a boycott in parts of Europe over the same issue.  Yet despite the tenor of Exxon Mobil's campaign, the company still stops short of saying that the combustion of fossil fuels is responsible for global warming. […]",positive,2002,11,21

PEPSICO,PEPSI unveils new eco-friendly bottle,"PEPSI has revealed their latest weapon-the world's first bottle made entirely of plant material. The company succeeded in making a bottle that is made from switch grass, pine bark, cornhusks and other materials in order to reduce the amount of carbon footprint- the 'total amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by an organization, event, act, or person,' reported the British Daily Mail on Tuesday. The new bottle looks, feels and protects the drink inside exactly the same as its current bottles, said a company spokesman. This discovery potentially changes the industry standard for plastic packaging. Traditional PET plastic is widely used because it is lightweight and shatter-resistant, its safety is well researched and it does not affect flavors. However, it is not biodegradable. Rather it is fully recyclable, a characteristic that will be maintained in the new creation. In addition, PET plastic is made using fossil fuels, like petroleum, a limited resource rising in price. As a result, by using plant material instead, companies reduce their environmental impact. Ultimately, PEPSI plans to also use orange peel, oat husks, potato scraps, and other leftovers from its food business. After the initial testing stage in 2012 with a few hundred thousand bottles and once it are sure it can successfully produce the bottle at that scale, the company will begin converting all its products. Coca-Cola currently produces a bottle using 30 per cent plant-based materials and recently estimated it would be several years before it has a 100 per cent plant bottle.",positive,2011,3,16

BANK OF AMERICA,Green bonds - Banks get climate smart,"[…] Green bond bubbles? Citi, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America Merrill Lynch were planning to roll out their own Green Bond Principles on 1 1, say Citi officials. According to a draft published by EuroWeek, the principles provide issuers of green bonds with disclosure and transparency guidelines. However, the principles leave it up to each issuer, whether a corporate, bank or municipality, to decide which criteria to employ to define the green use of the bonds. (Several climate-friendly and environmental definitions that have already been used in the market by the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, the European Investment Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development, and others are listed in an appendix that green bond issuers may refer to if they want). Meanwhile, Christopher Flensborg, head of sustainable products and product development at SEB, says another framework designed for a global green bond market and including input from banks in the US, European and Asia will be ready in ""six to nine months"". It will be different in other important respects from the Citi, JPMorgan and BANK OF AMERICA endeavour, which, Mr Flensborg says was ""too rushed"". The Citi officials' response is: ""The market is not waiting. For example, Citi already has two mandates to lead manage green bond issues [in 2014]."" To avoid the confusion of different definitions of green, it is important to establish a single set of definitions, says Mr Flensborg.

GOOGLE,The weather exploiters,"Tim Flannery, the radical Australian environmentalist, quoted Adam Smith this week during a CBC Radio interview, thus surely sending the great economist spinning once more in his Edinburgh grave. Promoting his latest book, Now or Never, on The Current, Mr. Flannery cited the Sage of Kirkcaldy's warning against attempts by businessmen to influence policy: ""The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order [merchants or manufacturers], ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention."" True indeed, which makes it intriguing that Mr. Flannery should regard Al Gore, who has made, and stands to make, hundreds of millions of dollars from promoting government subsidy and regulation, as one of his heroes.  Even more strange, or perhaps just spectacularly hypocritical, that Mr. Flannery-- whose previous book, The Weather Makers, was a bestseller -- should head something called the Copenhagen Climate Council, which is a morass of the kind of corporatist influence against which Adam Smith was warning. The council's members include Combat Climate Change, which represents -among others --GE, Unilever, Citigroup, BP and Siemens. Then there is The Climate Group, whose corporate members include Bloomberg, Coca Cola, Dell, Google and IBM. Another member is the World Business Council on Sustainable Development, which was set up by the UN's former chief Global Salvationist, Maurice Strong, to push the crypto-socialist blueprint hatched by the Brundtland Commission. Then we have the World Economic Forum, yet another mercantilist organization of the self-appointed Great and Good, where Mr. Strong again had enormous influence until he was inconveniently implicated in the UN oil-for-food corruption scandal. The Copenhagen Climate Council's ""sponsors"" meanwhile consist of a group of mainly Danish corporations who make no secret of their desire to influence policy.

GENERAL ELECTRIC, Bush's simple pollution solution," It worked brilliantly for his father, so why doesn't today's US President adopt emissions trading? A dozen years ago, when I first lived in the US, the great environmental terror was not global warming, but acid rain. Sulphur dioxide pollution from industrial smokestacks and nitrogen oxide, mainly from vehicle exhaust, was combining with moisture in the atmosphere to form acids that killed lakes and forests and threatened human health. I read so many warnings about acid rain that I took to wearing a hat in inclement weather, convinced that my hair was falling out due to gradual chemical erosion.   But then, almost overnight, those looming clouds of acid rain cleared. The tales of acidulous devastation stopped. I gave up wearing my hat. […] By far the largest polluter, of course, is the US, and without American participation the prospect of a genuinely global, properly regulated carbon-trading market seems distant. President Bush remains adamantly opposed to capping emissions, arguing that this would impede the US economy. Ironically, US corporations believe that they could make big money in a global carbon-trading system, but until the US regulates emissions and issues pollution permits, they have nothing to buy or sell. Mr Bush should embrace global curbs on emissions now, because if these do not come during his presidency, they will most assuredly come after it. Already there are signs of a change of mood in the US, in both political and corporate circles. This year more than 150 American cities have signed agreements to meet emission cutting targets, and a growing number of corporate chiefs, most recently Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of GENERAL ELECTRIC, have called for domestic control of CO2 emissions. Last week the US Senate considered two different bills containing proposals, supported by several prominent Republicans, for a US carbon-trading scheme. Would this be as prohibitively expensive and economically damaging to cut emissions as the White House claims?

PFIZER,VIAGRA'S OTHER CONTRIBUTION,"Bob Dole, seal savior. By pushing his favorite pill, the former senator may be doing more to protect wildlife than he ever did as a public servant. How so? A new study shows that when men start popping Viagra instead of traditional potency pills made of seal penises and such (for real!), the demand for those animals goes down. […] Unfortunately, the von Hippels could not study Viagra's impact on any truly endangered species because trafficking in these animals is illegal, so no one is keeping sales records. But Joshua Ginsberg of the Wildlife Conservation Society - i.e., the Bronx Zoo - believes, ""There are a variety of endangered species that could benefit [from the drug's popularity]."" Turtle eggs, hyena lips, gorilla genitalia - perhaps one day PFIZER's phenom will replace them all as perker-uppers. Let's hope.

[…] Historically, Virgin has always operated four-engined aircraft on its long-haul transatlantic routes, arguing that passengers feel safer than flying in a jet with only two engines. But Virgin will justify the switch in approach on the grounds that twin-engined aircraft are more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly. The airline will also announce today that it is to become the first carrier in the world to use green aviation fuel. Virgin Atlantic is planning to launch trials next year with Boeing and the US engine manufacturer GENERAL ELECTRIC, flying a 747 aircraft using a mixture of bio-fuel and conventional aviation fuel.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,IN FOCUS: Green spotlight shines on noise and air qualityKeeping the noise down; Attention may be focused on carbon emissions but the problem of air and sound pollution will not go away,"""Ecomagination"" underpins new GE designs Opponents to a third runway at London's Heathrow airport believe air-quality concerns could help them defeat expansion plans When aviation hits the headlines over its impact on the environment, the focus is usually on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions - noise and air quality are generally overlooked. ""When you look at how airlines communicate on their sustainability performance, it looks like we are heading towards a single-issue discussion,"" says Jeroen Kruijd, an airline sustainability expert at PwC. ""We should be careful not to focus only on climate change."" PwC report Building Trust In The Air reveals that while 70% of airlines report on their carbon emissions, only 40% report on NOX (nitrogen oxide) emissions and just 33% publish data on noise. However, these issues, the focus of environmental concern for decades before climate change reared its head, have refused to go away. In fact they are often of more concern to airlines and airports, and dealing with them is crucial to the future health of the sector.  ""These are areas where we have a bit of a black eye and need to continue to work hard,"" says Steve Csonka, head of ""ecomagination"" at GE Aviation. ""Noise and local air quality have more impact on the debate in terms of stopping runway development and preventing operation at certain times of the day."" Indeed, opponents of a third runway at London's Heathrow airport believe air-quality concerns could help them defeat plans to expand the airport. One of the main air pollutants caused by aviation is nitrogen dioxide (NO2). EU rules based on World Health Organisation guidelines limit the amount of NO2 that can be present in the environment. This limit is consistently broken in London, which has one of the highest NO2 levels of any EU city. Important drivers Environmental group ClientEarth believes any plans for a third runway could be legally challenged because planning permission must be refused if a development is likely to breach air quality limits or worsen air quality where pollution already exceeds the limits. Meanwhile, noise levels are one of the most important drivers of local opposition to airport expansions. The International Civil Aviation Organisation says that by 2020, the number of people affected by ""annoying levels of aircraft noise"" in Europe will be 40% higher than in 2001. ICAO catalogues the pollutants associated with aviation operations: NOX can cause lung irritation and lower resistance to respiratory infections, and has been linked to acid rain, visibility degradation, particle formation, and ozone formation. Carbon monoxide can cause cardiovascular effects, especially in those with heart conditions. Volatile organic compounds - such as benzene and acrolein - can cause eye and respiratory irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders and memory impairment, and can contribute to ozone formation. Ozone can impair lung function and increase susceptibility to respiratory infection. Lower emissions Innovations in engine technology such as GE Aviation's lean-burn technology help alleviate air quality issues. ""We're getting about 50% lower NOX emissions than the latest standards,"" Csonka says. Fuel efficiency improvements also help - less fuel burnt means fewer emissions. However, Csonka warns that while the emphasis has been on NOX, focus will turn to particulates, where evidence is emerging of serious health effects such as premature mortality and aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease.

PFIZER,PFIZER greens chemistry INTRODUCTION: The pharmaceutical giant has been developing green solutions for over a decade,"SOUND STEWARDSHIP of the environment does more than please PFIZER employees and protect the company's brand, it also saves the drug giant tens of millions of dollars every year, and even hundreds of millions of dollars over the lifetime of particularly high-volume products.In other words, green chemistry is not just a moral issue it's also a value proposition. PFIZER began its green chemistry initiative (GCI) in 2001, encouraged by improvements made in the manufacture of sertraline (Zoloft) and sildenafil (Viagra), says Peter Dunn, global green chemistry leader.[…] In the late 1990s, PFIZER chemists developed a more efficient approach that condensed three steps to one, dramatically reducing the consumption of three raw materials and completely eliminating titanium tetrachloride. For every [short] ton of sertraline produced, the new process also saved 60,000 gallons of solvent. For its achievement, PFIZER was awarded the Green Synthetic Pathways Award of the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge by the US Environmental Protection Agency in 2002. During the same period, PFIZER chemists were greening the manufacture of sildenafil, as well. The new approach reduced waste production and won the Crystal Faraday Award for Green Chemical Technology from the UK Institute of Chemical Engineers (IChemE ) in 2003.To build on these successes, PFIZER institutionalized green chemistry in the GCI, creating the position that Dunn now fills. Working with Steve Brooks, vice president, PFIZER Global Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Operations, Dunn manages a global green chemistry network that extends from central technical and policy communication teams to local teams driving fundamental changes in practice.[…] On the manufacturing side, which necessarily produces the most waste, the goal is set in terms of the ""E-factor"", a measure of environmental impact that is simply a ratio of the mass of waste produced to the mass of product. Typical pharmaceutical manufacturing processes have an E-factor of 50-100. PFIZER's goal is to lower its own E-factor below 50.[…] Every reaction in pregabalin synthesis is carried out in water - an achievement that may be unique in API manufacturing. PFIZER estimates that between 2007 and 2020, the aqueous process will save 185,000 tons (168,000 tonnes) of solvent and 20,000 tons of reagent. It will also use 83% less energy than before. Because of its high efficiency and reduced footprint, the process also saves PFIZER production capacity.

But for now, Silicon Valley is taking green energy down a different path.","Even before Solyndra became synonymous with the perils of the green-technology industry, the industry was changing. Grand plans, like those of Solyndra to bring solar energy to firms nationwide, still ripple through Silicon Valley, but quietly. The current economic slump and Chinese competition have taken a toll.

[…] In the B-to-B world, everyone has a sustainability target to hit, so every customer along the supply chain is demanding more from their suppliers than in the past. The Walmart effect has put a new premium on greening the supply chain. And purchasers understand that they can be held accountable by the public for their suppliers' actions. So pressure that begins externally - in the net's 24-hour court of public opinion and among a press ready to feed the beast - winds up being passed along every link in the chain.

GENERAL ELECTRIC,Sechin attends foundation stone laying ceremony for new production facility,"Rosneft President and Chairman of the Management Board Igor Sechin took part in a foundation stone laying ceremony that launched the construction of a facility that will produce gas turbine units in the city of Rybinsk in the Yaroslavl region of Russia.  The ceremony took place on Wednesday, October 312, Rosneft said. The facility, which is being built by Russian Gas Turbines (a joint venture between GENERAL ELECTRIC, INTER RAO and the United Engine Corporation), will in begin producing and servicing 77MW low-emission high-efficiency 6FA packaged gas turbine units in the second quarter of 2014 Five packaged turbine units will be supplied by GENERAL ELECTRIC for a thermal power plant at the Eastern Petrochemical Company, a major Rosneft project. The first turbines are expected to arrive in the third quarter of 2014. Rosneft's order created conditions for the launch of the plant, the company said. Rosneft and GENERAL ELECTRIC signed an agreement for servicing five 6FA packaged gas turbine units to be supplied by GE under the agreement signed in 6 for the thermal power plant at the Eastern Petrochemical Company, which is currently under construction by Rosneft. The agreement will run for 16 years and is GE's largest service contract in Russia. The company will provide technical support and full-cycle routine technical maintenance of the turbines, their components and generators. GE will also be responsible for maintaining the availability factor of the turbines, as well as power output and the heat rate. The low-emission and highly fuel efficient 6FA package gas turbine units at the Eastern Petrochemical Company's power plant will operate in line with international environmental standards.

BANK OF AMERICA,Building Green; Bigger Projects Have More Sustainable Feature Options,"Sustainable development may be a hot ticket in the construction world, but one size doesn't always fit all. While projects of every size have options, several New York developers say larger buildings enjoy a broader menu of green systems and features.  An informal tour around some of the largest projects in New York seeking Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design status from the U.S. Green Building Council underscores that big projects - especially those larger than 250,000-sq.-ft. - are able to capitalize on systems like water treatment or power generation that just don't make sense for a smaller structure. Those options in turn help to decide whether a building will have enough features to qualify for the highest LEED designations of gold and platinum.Manhattan has its share of bigger structures seeking the status, including the 856,000-sq.-ft. tower that Hearst, the media corporation, is building over its base headquarters on 57th Street. Others include the 2.1-million-sq.-ft. BANK OF AMERICA tower on Sixth Avenue, a new 299,000-sq.-ft. residential tower at Battery Park City, and the 1.7-million-sq.-ft. 7 World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. Meanwhile, two major planned projects include a 2-million-sq.-ft. headquarters tower at Battery Park City for Goldman Sachs, the financial services company, and the 1,776-ft.-tall Freedom Tower at the former World Trade Center site.[…] The BANK OF AMERICA tower, known as One Bryant Park, is also a high-profile project, because its developers are striving for platinum LEED certification. The 54-story building rising between 42nd and 43rd streets is expected be the first office tower in New York to achieve that highest LEED status upon its completion in 2008.[…]",positive,2005,3,1

PROCTER & GAMBLE,Corporate: Syed Mokhtar offers FGV 30% stake in Tradewinds Plantation,"Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGV) is being offered a 30% equity stake in Tradewinds Plantation Bhd, says outgoing president and chief executive Tan Sri Datuk Sabri Ahmad.  But the deal may not materialise because FGV wants a bigger stake to gain control of the oil palm plantationâ  s assets, Sabri adds. […] â  The peat soil component is probably a negative [for FGV],â  Sabri says. This could be crucial for palm oil players who intend to sell biofuel to the European Union, which is very stringent about compliance with sustainability standards. â  Many companies and big multinationals such as Nestle and PROCTER & GAMBLE will not buy unless it [palm oil and biofuel products] is certified sustainable,â  says Sabri. Environmental groups are against the development of peat soil because palm oil producers typically burn peat forests when expanding their plantations, which emit large amounts of carbon dioxide. It is also more expensive to plant on peat soil than on mineral soil as water levels must be maintained via a complicated series of drainage systems. â "" By Janice Melissa Thean",positive,2013,6,24
INTERNATIONAL BUS.MCHS.,Companies need a conscience: Hewson,"Former Liberal leader John Hewson has issued a warning to companies failing to meet their social obligations: starting thinking about the environment and the community, or face rejection by consumers.  A report on Australia's top 100 public and private firms released by Professor Hewson yesterday suggested that Australian companies are lagging behind their North American and European counterparts on so-called triple bottom-line measures.[…] Westpac was rated the most socially responsible company in Australia, and was alone in scoring the top mark of AAA. It rated in the top four on all criteria. Ten companies received AA ratings, including IBM Australia, Australia Post, Shell Australia, Alcoa, Visy Industries, BHP Billiton and Coca-Cola Amatil. Media giant PBL, retailer David Jones, insurers AMP and AXA and private health fund Medibank were among those that rated unsatisfactory.[…] Dr Hewson chairs the rating committee that consulted 19 organisations including Greenpeace, unions, accountants and social services to produce the ratings.[…]",positive,2003,10,14
CHEVRON,"China, US coal-bed methane projects awaiting go-ahead","Text of report in English by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency). […] Beijing, 6 6 (Xinhua) - Plans to develop two of the 15 large coal-bed methane capture projects, proposed during the Second US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue, are on the drawing board, according to China United Coal-bed Methane Corporation (CUCMC). […] The CUCMC is the only company in China authorized by the government to cooperate with foreign partners in coal-bed methane mining and development. Eleven projects are located in north China's Shanxi Province, with the other four in Anhui, Shaanxi, Jiangxi and Yunnan provinces. CHEVRON has invested in four projects, Greka Energy in five, Far East Energy in three, and MidAmerican Energy Holdings, ORION Energy International and Asian American Gas Inc. in one each. Under the contracts, foreign investors will fund exploration. After the projects go into production and the exploration funding is repaid, the Chinese and foreign investors will share the proceeds according to their investments. Coal-bed gas is a natural product during the conversion of plant material to coal. Utilization of the clean fuel could contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and help relieve China's energy shortages. […]",positive,2007,6,6
PROCTER & GAMBLE,A solid program to reduce waste; Subaru factory sets new standards for going green and reduces costs in the process,"Beyond the vehicle itself, automakers are ""greening"" the factories where they're produced. Whether to save money, meet standards or present a more responsible face to the community, auto manufacturers are reducing their energy requirements and the amount of waste generated.The local Subaru plant, which builds the Legacy, Outback and Tribeca, and the Camry for Toyota, became zero waste-to-landfill in May 2004. It was the first automotive plant in the U.S. to be ISO 14001 certified for its environmental management systems, and has a wildlife sanctuary on its grounds. While not unique - all automakers have various environmentally-conscious operations - Subaru of Indiana Automotive (SIA) goes beyond reduce, reuse and recycle at a plant that sits amid some of the country's richest farmland.[…] Other manufacturers have studied the plant for their own operations, including PROCTER & GAMBLE and Frito-Lay. SIA has recycling programs in local schools, including nearby Purdue University. ""We have an outreach program to the students in schools,"" Coogan says.

PEPSICO,Guide highlights tensions in corporate engagement,"A business guide to working with environmental organisations highlights the tensions between firms' need for advice and campaigners' desire for change. WWF and Forum for the Future top the list of groups that companies could seek to work with to reduce their environmental impacts, research by analysts Verdantix has found. The report provides advice for corporate responsibility directors on a dozen organisations with a range of stances on environmental protection Some are campaign groups such as WWF, Oxfam and Flora and Fauna International. Others, such as Forum for the Future and Tomorrow's Company operate like business consultants. Verdantix excluded Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace because they do not have proactive business partnership programmes.  […]  It concludes WWF and Forum for the Future offer a breadth of expertise closely aligned with corporate environmental agendas. For instance, Forum can advise on profiting from a more sustainable business strategy. Both organisations have had a recognised impact on business decisions. For example, WWF's campaign to cut business flights by 20% in five years gained support from several high-profile firms (ENDS Report 414, p11). Both also have a track record of mutually beneficial partnerships with leading brands, such as Forum with PEPSI and WWF with Marks and Spencer (M&S). […]",positive,2009,12,23

BANK OF AMERICA,U.N. summit highlights climate risk; Investment community sees 'seminal change' toward addressing GHG emissions,"Pressure is increasing on the U.S. government and the investment community to address climate change. Some 450 institutional investors, pension plans and corporate executives at a high-profile meeting last month at the United Nations called on Wall Street and policymakers to address the issue. Many of those present said Congress should establish a mandatory national policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and encouraged the financial community to put a price tag on carbon pollution. […] The meeting was hosted by Ceres, a Boston-based coalition of institutional investors and environmental groups that work with companies to address sustainability issues, together with the United Nations Foundation of Washington. Their efforts may be having some effect. Activists at the U.N. meeting were crowing about the announcement early this month that Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley, all of New York, had adopted a set of principles under which they would factor in the risks of carbon emissions, along with mitigation strategies, used by utility clients. Also this month, Ken Lewis, chief executive of BANK OF AMERICA Corp., said the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank will start assessing the cost of carbon in its financing decisions. ``This is a seminal change in Wall Street's recognition of this as an issue,'' Kevin Parker, global head of Frankfurt, Germany-based Deutsche Bank AG's asset management division, said during a panel discussion at the U.N. gathering.[…]",positive,2008,3,17
BANK OF AMERICA,"Look before you leap into the green; Climate change funds may be all the rage, but they are not for everyone","Climate change has long been a red-hot issue among the green set, but now money managers are jumping on the bandwagon as well. Schroders, HSBC and DWS Investments are among those that reckon there is something they can sell to investors and they have been launching specially tailored funds. Climate change funds work like typical funds, but essentially focus on investing in companies from climate change and environment-related industries. These include renewable or low- carbon energy, energy efficiency, and water and pollution management. […] In 2008, banking giants Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley signed on to climate change industry standards like the Carbon Principles, which aim 'to standardise the assessment of carbon risks in the financing of electric power projects in the US'. Since the principles were released, Wells Fargo, BANK OF AMERICA and Credit Suisse have also signed on.
