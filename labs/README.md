Here you will find everything needed for the labs. The labs have the same basic structure:

1. Walkthroughs: The TAs will guide you through Google Cloud which explains how to practically apply concepts seen in the lectures. These notebooks will greatly help you solve the exercises and the assignment, therefore, it will only benefit you to pay close attention.
2. Exercises: You will do some exercises, either by yourselves or in small groups
3. Solutions: Motivated students will be able to share their solutions (remember, often there is an infinite number of solutions to any problem!) with the class. If no group volunteers, the TAs will present a sample solution.

Also, when the project will kick off, during the labs you will be able to ask for advice about your group project. 

If you have questions or face problems you cannot resolve during the labs, do not hesitate to ask for clarifications. If you have questions after the labs, please use our slack channel. Also, remember that Google/ChatGPT are your friends, especially while coding!

We are looking forward to a great semester with you.
