Therefore, we need to create a web service accesible via the Internet, so that we can send the data from the device to that web service.

To do so, we need to make the calls to this endpoint __authenticated__. One way to do that is to set up a password which will be checked on the flask server. To avoid sending the password from the IoT device in plain text, we need to hash this password first and send it to the flask server. In the flask server, the correct hash string is already stored and each time a post request is made the received hash string (from the IoT device) will be checked against the stored hash string. In the `m5stack.py` script, see how we have set-up a password and converted it to a hash string. In the `main.py` script (flask app), see how the correctness of the hash string is checked for each post request. To know more about hash functions, check the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function).\n",
